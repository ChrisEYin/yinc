            <p><p>Stumbled across this a few days ago. Really good stuff, so wanted to re-post it.</p>

<p>1.Know what you want. Clarity is power. And vague goals promote vague results.</p>

<p>2.Remember that every problem has a solution. Maybe you just can’t see it. Yet.</p>

<p>3.In this Age of Dramatic Distraction, the performer who focuses the best wins the most.</p>

<p>4.Before someone will help you, you need to help them.</p>

<p>5.Become the most passionate person you know. It’ll be contagious.</p>

<p>6.Know more about your craft/the work you do than anyone who has ever done the work you do…in the history of the world.</p>

<p>7.Join The 5 am Club. Your most valuable hours are 5am-8am. They have the least interruptions.</p>

<p>8.Devote yourself to learning something new about your field of mastery every day. Success belongs to the relentless learners. Because as you know more, you can achieve more.</p>

<p>9.Remember that when you transform your fitness, you’ll transform your business.</p>

<p>10.Don’t check your mobile when you’re meeting with another person. It’s rude. And rude people don’t reach world-class.</p>

<p>11.Every time you do what scares you, you take back the power that you gave to the thing that scared you. And so you become more powerful.</p>

<p>12.A problem is only a problem if you make the choice to see it as a problem.</p>

<p>13.Stop being a victim. Your business and personal life was made by you. No one else is responsible. To make it better, make better choices. And new decisions.</p>

<p>14.You can lead without a title. Don’t wait to get a position to stand for excellence, peak quality and overdelivery on every expectation.</p>

<p>15.Find your own style. Be an original. Every superstar differentiated themselves from The Herd. And marched to their own drumbeat.</p>

<p>16.Understand that when you play small with your success, you betray your potential. And the birthright you were born under.</p>

<p>17.Eat less food and you’ll get more done.</p>

<p>18.As you become more successful, stay really really hungry. Nothing fails like success. Because when you’re successful, it’s easy to stop outlearning+outOverDelivering+outthinking and outexecuting everyone around you. (Success is Beautiful. And dangerous).</p>

<p>19.If you’re not overprepared, you’re underprepared.</p>

<p>20.The only level of great manners to play at is “Exceedingly Polite”. In our world, this alone will make you a standout. And differentiate you in your marketplace.</p>

<p>21.Remember that the moment you think you’re a Master, you lose your Mastery. And the minute you think you know everything, you know nothing.</p>

<p>22.To double your results, double your level of execution.</p>

<p>23.Invest in your personal and pro development. All superstars do.</p>

<p>24.Get this year’s best Targets of Opportunity down onto a 1 Page Plan. Then review it every morning while the rest of the world sleeps.</p>

<p>25.You don’t get lucky. You create lucky.</p>

<p>26.When you push through a difficult project, you don’t get to the other side. You reach The Next Level.</p>

<p>27.Smile. And remember to inform your face.</p>

<p>28.Spend time in solitude every day. Your best ideas live there.</p>

<p>29.Debrief on how you lived out your day every night in a journal. This will not only record your personal history, it will make you uber-clear on what you’re doing right and what needs to be improved.</p>

<p>30.If your not being criticized a lot, you’re not doing very much. Ridicule is the price of ambition.</p>

<p>31.Develop a monomaniacal focus on just a few things. The secret to productivity is simplicity.</p>

<p>32.To get the results very few people have, be strong enough to do what very few people are willing to do.</p>

<p>33.Rest. Recover. It’ll make you stronger.</p>

<p>34.Buy a smaller TV and build a larger library.</p>

<p>35.Remember that the bigger the goal, the stronger a person you must become to achieve that goal. So goal-achieving is a superb practice for character-building.</p>

<p>36.Food fuels your body. Learning feeds your mind.</p>

<p>37.Don’t ask for respect. Earn it.</p>

<p>38.Finish what you start. And always end strong.</p>

<p>39.Breathe.</p>

<p>40.In business, don’t play to survive. Play to win.</p>

<p>41.Protect your good name. It’s your best asset.</p>

<p>42.Remember that words have power. Use the language of leadership versus the vocabulary of a victim.</p>

<p>43.Give more than you take. The marketplace rewards generosity.</p>

<p>44.Know that if it’s not messy, you’re not making progress.</p>

<p>45.Be a hero to a kid.</p>

<p>46.In business, aim for iconic. Go for legendary. Make history by how awesome you are at what you do.</p>

<p>47.Please don’t confuse activity with productivity. Many many people are simply busy being busy.</p>

<p>48.Your doubts are liars. Your fears are traitors. Stop buying the goods they are attempting to sell you.</p>

<p>49.The best anti-aging remedy in the world is working really hard.</p>

<p>50.World-Class performers have no plan B. Failure just isn’t an option.</p>

<p>51.You have the power to change the world—one brave act and one person at a time. Please use it.</p>

            <h2 class="title"><a href="/2013/03/25/how-i-use-the-web/" rel="prefetch">How I Use The Web</a></h2>
            <p><p>Recently people have been asking how I use the web. Not sure why, but thought I’d write it down.</p>

<p>I use the web to get better at things I’m bad at. These are the apps that help me. All are free (some with paid options).</p>

<p>Things that are important to me are health, finances, productivity, reading, writing, thinking, and self reflection.</p>

<p><strong>Health</strong></p>

<p>Meal Tracking – <a href="http://bit.ly/14ipM6q">My Fitness Pal</a>. I’ve tried a few and they have the best food database. Easy to log, create custom foods, and repeat common foods. At the end of each day they tell you “If you ate like this every day, you would weight X”, which is a nice reminder (although it never goes down).</p>

<p>Exercise – I use <a href="http://bit.ly/14ipSLd">Sworkit</a> in the mornings I’m too busy (or too lazy) for a real workout to give me a quick routine based on what I want to focus on and how much time I have. When I do have time to run, <a href="http://bit.ly/YP0aGv">Runkeeper</a> is the best. Also since I live a pretty sedentary lifestyle (<a href="http://chriseyin.wordpress.com/2013/03/24/standing-desk/">hopefully this will change it</a>), I also use <a href="http://bit.ly/14ipSeh">Moves</a>. It’s a beautiful pedometer – helps me remember to get out and move a bit more.</p>

<p>Sleep – <a href="http://bit.ly/14ipXhP">Sleep Timer</a> is amazing. Developed by the prodigies at Azumio, Sleep Timer gradually sounds an alarm when you’re in a lighter sleep so you wake up more naturally as opposed to being interrupted by an alarm during REM sleep. Also provides metrics on sleep patterns – average sleep time, duration, efficiency, and more. Really cool stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Productivity</strong></p>

<p>Task Management – <a href="http://www.asana.com">Asana</a>. It is the best, and I’ve tried them a bunch of them. It’s light, fast, and easy to use. Downside is their mobile app sucks right now. Mobile is for smaller on the go tasks(essentially chores), so in its place I use <a href="http://bit.ly/14ipWdP">Todoist</a>. It keeps Asana clean, and when I get a free moment I’ll just run through a few Todoist tasks to feel good about myself.</p>

<p>Calendar – <a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a> is my default web calendar and is viewed on the phone through <a href="http://bit.ly/YP0lBE">Sunrise</a>. Although as of late I’ve been trying out <a href="http://bit.ly/14iq2lT">Tempo</a>, and it’s not half bad — Sunrise looks better, but Tempo can auto dial conference call passcodes. Which is pretty nice.</p>

<p><strong>Reading</strong></p>

<p>News – I have a pretty long list of blogs and news sites that I keep in <a href="http://bit.ly/14iq512">Google Reader</a>. I’ve spent years building this list, and it is my primary source of news consumption. That’s why I was <a href="http://chriseyin.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/trust-in-a-consumer-business/">slightly annoyed about Google Reader getting axed</a>.</p>

<p>Curated – <a href="http://bit.ly/14iq90w">Quibb</a>, <a href="http://www.svbtle.com">Svbtle</a>, and <a href="http://www.medium.com">Medium</a>, in that order. Save all the good articles in <a href="http://www.getpocket.com">Pocket</a> for reference. Questions/discussions are directed to <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a>/<a href="http://www.branch.com">Branch</a>.</p>

<p>Books – I have an enormous backlog of things to read on my <a href="http://amzn.com/w/14VFOBTRXIMDJ">Amazon Reading List</a>. I pick a book from there every once in a while (a long while) and throw it on the Kindle.</p>

<p><strong>Finance</strong></p>

<p>Personal – I use <a href="http://bit.ly/14iqh00">Mint</a> to keep track of all personal expenses. Really easy to use, integrates well with banks, and nice graphs. The best feature is budgets — easy to set and stay within my limits every month.</p>

<p>Work – I use <a href="http://www.xpenser.com">Xpenser</a> to keep track of work related expense (mainly purchases and time).</p>

<p><strong>Writing</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/YP0y7H">Draft</a>. It’s easy to use and version control is really nice. I can quickly jot down some thoughts – edit, edit, edit – and then go back to see how my thoughts have progressed. Plus it just looks and feels great. Once I’m done, I copy and publish with <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">WordPress</a>. Although now I’m using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking</strong></p>

<p>I’m always jotting down ideas and thoughts on my phone. I need <a href="http://bit.ly/14iqlNB">Evernote</a> for that. Easy to use and syncs across all devices. I take all of my ideas/observations from the week, cut the crappy ones (so almost all of it), and then save in a Google Doc for long term tracking.</p>

<p><strong>Self Improvement</strong></p>

<p>Vocab – I try to learn new words on a regular basis. I use <a href="http://bit.ly/10tTCBz">Evernote Clearly</a> to read on the web and save words I don’t know with highlighter. The ones I actually want to learn go into <a href="http://bit.ly/YP0CEF">StudyBlue</a>. It’s just flash cards — easy to use and they have a nice mobile app so I can quiz myself on the go.</p>

<p>Goals &amp; Progress – I write down a single goal in Google Docs every week and then at the end of the week mark it either red (0%), yellow (somewhat done), or green (100% complete). The same for the month and the year. Daily habits that I’m trying to form go in <a href="http://lift.do">Lift</a>.</p>

<p>Journal – I like to keep a trail of my thoughts for self reflection, and that’s done in <a href="http://www.penzu.com">Penzu</a>. I don’t love it, but at this point I’m too invested in it to change.</p>

<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>

<p>Calls – <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> is still the predominant method. I hate it, but I have to use it. Google Voice for phone calls, and <a href="http://bit.ly/YP0Hbo">Viber</a> for international calls.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.join.me">Join.me</a> for screen sharing. <a href="http://www.uberconference.com">UberConference</a> for conference calls.</p>

<p>Storage - Drive, Dropbox, and Box.</p>

<p>Other: Sublime, S3, Heroku, Chrome, Twitter, Pandora, Cloudtab, Google Dictionary, Honey, Buffer, Bitly.</p></p>

            <p><p>I found myself trying out a few of <a href="http://on.mash.to/Xt809o">Evernote’s other apps</a> today (<a href="http://evernote.com/clearly/">Clearly</a> is amazing btw). Despite zero initial interest, necessity, coupled with bad reviews, I still managed to say eh, screw it — and download a few. I figured — it’s Evernote, they usually do cool stuff. I’ll give them a shot.</p>

<p>It made me think of <a href="http://bit.ly/16M7f1O">Keep</a>, Google’s new Evernote competitor. While I know very little about Keep, I knew that I had no intention of learning more. It was a strange feeling, given that I have historically been a Google groupie. I’m usually all over their new products and defend shitty ones. After all, they make great stuff and give it away for free! Plus, since most of the web tools I use are already built by Google, it almost always makes more sense to go Google (even if I’m already invested in a competitor) — single login, they already know me, integrates well with other Google services, etc.</p>

<p>But no more. Because of Reader. Every time I use a Google application now, I wonder — are they going to shut this down on a whim? They’ve always been the company that didn’t do that — they built incredibly cool products and they gave them away all for free. Even things that you were pretty sure couldn’t make money. That was the magic of Google. You know they’re using your data — but you don’t care. There’s an inherent trust. You actively opt in to sending back data, sending feedback in, etc. Because you trust that they’ll use that data to build something that makes your life better. Sure, they use your info to make some money — but who cares? It’s not malicious — their products add so much value, and they’re not evil, right? And it’s largely been true.</p>

<p>But in a consumer driven business where you’re using people’s personal information to profit, trust becomes your most important currency.</p>

<p>And they’ve lost my trust. Unceremoniously shutting down Reader to <a href="http://bit.ly/XtcFYX">focus</a> (<a href="http://bit.ly/XtcFYX">they called it spring cleaning</a>) was a major blow to their brand. And I’m not the only one that feels this way – <a href="http://bit.ly/16M7Alf">Om wrote a great post</a> about it, and there’s a <a href="http://oreil.ly/XtabcT">few</a> <a href="http://bit.ly/16M6plT">others</a> as well. I don’t trust them anymore and I won’t invest my time into another Google product and subsequently have to worry about it surviving another bout of spring cleaning.</p></p>

            <p><p>After closing the last work related tab on my browser the other day, I fired up Google Reader to catch up on some news and browse through the latest posts. Ironically, the first thing I saw was this: <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/13/google-kills-google-reader-will-go-offline-on-july-1-2013/">Google Kills Google Reader</a>.</p>

<p>Now while I lament the passing of Google Reader (and there’s tons of good stuff on why (<a href="http://blog.calbucci.com/2013/03/google-is-about-to-learn-tough-lesson.html">read here</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25VgNZDQ08">watch here</a>), I’m not here to complain. I’m fully aware that Google could not care less about how I feel about this.</p>

<p>But, If you’re as dependent on your RSS reader as I am, then what matters is finding a replacement.</p>

</ol>

<p>via <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5990456/google-reader-is-getting-shut-down-here-are-the-best-alternatives">LifeHacker</a> and Twitter</p>

<p>Now while I’m typically a pretty cheap guy, Google Reader was used so frequently and was such an important part of my day that I am perfectly happy spending a few dollars to get a good solution.</p>

<p>My ideal requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Web based</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>List style feed</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Seamless transfer from Google Reader</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A team that seems they care enough about RSS that they’re not just going to up and quit. (God forbid I have to go through this again!)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Magazine style feed option (I subscribe to a few design feeds, and I like to browse through the images for inspiration from time to time)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Similar interface (Learn how to use something new? Ridiculous!)</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The first one I found was Feedly. A quick search brought it up (they already had a <a href="http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/">blog post on it</a>! Impressive), and I was already familiar with Feedly – I tried it out when I was looking for a free RSS reader on my phone (did I mention I’m a cheap bastard?). Turns out it actually works pretty well – looks better than Google Reader, they can do a list based feed and magazine style, their transfer from Google Reader was nice, plus it was on the web and free. It wasn’t perfect, but it checked the boxes.</p>

<p>The other one everyone was raving about on Twitter was Prismatic. So I logged in, created an account, poked around, and left. It looked nice, but I thought they were trying to do a bit too much. While others users might need a place to discover news, I just need something that will take my Google Reader feed. Prismatic gave me too much, and couldn’t figure out how to import in my Google Reader account. (to their credit, the founder responded to my complaint immediately and told me how – it’s actually pretty easy). Still, was a bit too much for me and I couldn’t replicate the feed to what I needed – organizing feed list style by folders and viewing by folder/subscription.</p>

<p>MsgBoy just didn’t work for me. The Old Reader wasn’t allowing any importing (due to to large amounts of traffic). I ended up really liking Feedspot and Netvibes as well (looked and felt just like Google Reader), but Feedly did too, and Feedly looked a bit better.</p>

<p>Now for the paid options – Newsblur and Reeder. I would love to have paid for Reeder. But I need it to be on the web! So regrettable, had to axe this one as well. And despite all the hype, just really didn’t like Newblur’s interface.</p>

<p>So, ultimately I’m settling for Feedly (for now!) Seems to fit all of the criteria above best, and they have a nice mobile app to top it off. It seems to be the easiest way to continue living in a post Google Reader world.</p>

<p>Damn you, Google. You selfish bastards.</p></p>

            <p><p>After switching machines every 2 months for the better part of a year, I finally bought a permanent laptop. However, after constantly changing machines, this whole experience has made it very difficult for me to keep track of my desktop files — I have folders, files, things downloaded from the web (books/docs/music/films) — and then when I’m forced to a new machine, I have to consolidate all of my desktop files onto a flash/hard drive, and then put it on my new machine.</p>

<p>While this doesn’t sound that bad, when you take one disorganized group of folders and then add another group of disorganized folders to it (often with similar names), and then do it 6 or 7 times, things can start to get messy. For example, I’ll look for a PDF I downloaded — I know it was in my reading folder, but I’ll have to check Desktop/Machine1/Reading, Desktop/Machine2/Reading, Desktop/Machine3/Reading and so on to find it. And that can get cumbersome when you’re doing it all day.</p>

<p>So when I got my new computer, it was a chance for a clean slate — forget all the old messy folders, I can do it right this time. Only download files I actually need, organize them well, and keep as few files on my desktop as possible. As for the old files, I’ll throw them all onto an old hard drive under the folder ‘Archive’. You gotta cut your losses.</p>

<p>But I failed. Ultimately, I started downloading things, saving files, and then creating folders to organize all of this as desktop clutter started to build. And then sometimes I would get that nagging suspicion that I’ve already downloaded this same PDF 7 other times on every other machine and just never got around to reading it. Which means I’ve not only been hoarding files &amp; wasting space, but I’m also violating one main principle of life — not being selective enough about what I let into my life. Either I should’ve never downloaded it (demonstrating poor selection skills), or I should’ve read it already (demonstrating poor prioritization). Both are bad.</p>

<p>My strategy in real life to be selective and minimize unnecessary clutter — lay everything I have out in the open. This way it’s easy to see out what I’m actually using and not using. I can’t hide things in a box in the back of my closet. If it sits there and I haven’t touched it in months, I throw it away. Pretty simple.</p>

<p>So I decided to take the same strategy and apply it to my digital possessions. Minimize the amount of space so it’s easy to manage what I use, and discard what I don’t use. Also I wanted my solution to be in the cloud, because it makes the most sense. With the cloud, I’m actually limited by space (5GB on Dropbox is not a reasonable substitue for my 700GB hard drive), and it’s also accessible anywhere. I no longer have 700GB on my laptop, 1TB on my desktop, 200GB on my netbook and have to organize/maintain all of the different hard drives. My files are all in one place and they go with me everywhere. Machine agnostic.</p>

<p>I don’t want to have to open and fire up a web app every time I want to access my files, that’s a pain in the ass. There needs to be a desktop client as well. With that in mind, the options are pretty clear — Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box. I use all of these already, and so I took a look at how I’m currently using the services, and crafted a way to use them efficiently and mold it to my goal of moving my entire hard drive to the cloud.</p>

<p>Drive has largely replaced Microsoft Office for me. I’m using it on a daily basis for everything – to create spreadsheets, track sales, write copy/essays, track ideas/thoughts/goals, etc. Almost everything I do can be traced back to some sort of Google Doc. So I cleaned Drive up a bit and kept it that way. Drive would remain my main tool and my first option for any type of work.</p>

<p>As I looked through my Dropbox folder, I noticed that most of my folders in there are folders I share with other people. Mostly with me on the receiving end. While I do keep a bit of my own stuff in there, it’s mainly become a repository for shared info that can’t be done in Drive (code, pdf’s, contracts, etc). For the files that are personal, it’s mainly on the go material — reading. It has become sort of a flash drive, but in the cloud. I only have 5GB’s of space, so I can’t have all my files live in it. But the files on it are easy enough to access (Laptop, iPhone, iPad, Browser, and all without connection as well) that I will usually throw a PDF of a book in there before a flight or something. The added benefit is that everyone else uses it, so it’s easy to share files and pass around information. Since it’s only 5GB it can get of control pretty quickly if you have a lot of shared material, I’m going to try to keep it fairly ephemeral. Only books, music, documents, etc. that I need right now will be in there. Immediate consumption. It will conserve space, limit options and increase focus.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have Box. Pretty similar to Dropbox, except I have 50GB of space on there. It’s enough space to amass a good amount of stuff without quickly running out of space. But it’s also small enough that you don’t have a lot of room to hoard. If you’re downloading things as quickly as I am, you can fill up 50GB in a short amount of time if you’re not careful. Essentially only pictures, good books, and archived documents that are necessary will be saved onto there. Only qualified files that flow through Dropbox will enter Box. This ensures that most things in Box will actually be worth keeping — I’ve actually used the file in some capacity (probably read it), and I decided that it was worth keeping. Once in a while, I’ll probably have to go back and clean it out, but with only 50GB of space, it will be pretty quick to see what I’m actually using and not. This way I can start to curate a very high quality repository of information, and since I’ll have actually previously consumed all of the information, it will become a digital extension of my own knowledge.</p>

<p>With this funnel process — Drive to replace Office, Dropbox for keeping immediate files and sharing, and then Box as an archive of sorts — I can more easily reduce clutter and keep only the things that I actually need. In addition with everything I have in the cloud, theoretically, I’m making another step towards being truly machine agnostic. Which is cool, right?</p>

<p><em>Update: 5/23/2013</em></p>

<p>Got a new laptop from Coupa the other day, and started working on it with next to zero setup.</p>

<p>I leave my Coupa laptop at the office and my personal one at home. One day at work, I needed a file and looked on my Desktop and — shit, new computer. But oh wait! Found it in Box. Amazing.</p></p>

            <p><p>A few months ago, I wrote a post called Experiments. I was going to shift the purpose of my blog to become an idea/experiments driven outlet. The supposed goal was to gain insight about my ideas, learn, and get better at writing.</p>

<p>It all sounded great. This would create a purpose for the list of ideas that was accruing in my Evernote account. I would consistently learn about new things. I would have an excuse to write a bit more. Maintain a backlog of things to build. Checks all the boxes.</p>

<p>In reality, it didn’t work out that way. I found that while coming up with good ideas on a monthly basis wasn’t that hard (and I use the word good pretty liberally here), finding the time to actually test them out was near impossible.</p>

<p>Writing and coming up with the experiments to prove/disprove theories wasn’t hard. My drafts box is full of them. Google up some articles, look at some companies doing similar things, and then come up with some way to test the core theory behind it.</p>

<p>Taking the next step was what the tough part. I simply didn’t have time to build something and get real feedback that mattered every month. In the end, produced very little — a few half baked blog posts and web apps.</p>

<p>Turns out vetting ideas takes time (big surprise). And turns out that it’s not worth vetting ideas for the sake of getting better at vetting ideas. I had no desire to take them anywhere — I was happy with current work, and wanted to finish it out, not jump into some other wild goose chase on whim. This prohibited my ability to really prove/disprove things — frankly, I didn’t really care. I wasn’t going to do anything with it. In reality, I just wanted something to write about.</p>

<p>That’s when I got it. I just wanted to write about something. Turns out I’m just bad at coming up with things to write about. So I read <a href="http://paulgraham.com/essay.html">Paul Graham’s post on writing</a>. His point is that you don’t need a well defined thesis or point to write. He compares writing to a river.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The river’s algorithm is simple. At each step, flow down. For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting. Of all the places to go next, choose the most interesting. One can’t have quite as little foresight as a river. I always know generally what I want to write about. But not the specific conclusions I want to reach; from paragraph to paragraph I let the ideas take their course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no explicit purpose. An idea strikes you — just start writing. Let the ideas come out and take you somewhere. You don’t need a well crafted plan of what to write and what not to write. You just let it go where it goes. A lot of the stuff you write might suck and never take you anywhere interesting (I know a lot of mine do!). But you’ll have explored a new area — and once in awhile, you might actually write something worth reading.</p></p>

            <p><p>So, my first time doing one of these things, but I love Fanhattan and wanted to throw my opinion in. So here goes.</p>

<p><strong>The Product (iPad)</strong></p>

<p>Fanhattan is a catalogue of all film/TV media on the web that gives consumers a single point of discovery.</p>

<p>You search for things, Fanhattan tells you where it lives, and you can go there and watch it. Revenue is through affiliate marketing.</p>

<p>What Fanhattan ultimately wants from their users is what I’m going to call an Action. Action == Watching == Affiliate Revenue.</p>

<p>The user experience cycle goes from what I call Discovery –&gt; Intrigued –&gt; Learn More, then back to Discovery. Every stage should lead to an Action.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.chrisyin.com/static/fanhattan-circle.png" alt="Fanhattan-Circle" /></p>

<p>While Fanhattan currently follows the cycle shown above, I think the UX has drop offs at certain points, and it would be nice to see a more fluid experience that gives me the info I need when I want it, encourages me to take action, and keeps bringing me back to Discovery. (Basing this off of personal experience, opinions may change if I were to look at user data.)</p>

<p>Let’s focus on the movie section. We’ll start at Discovery, move to Intrigued, Learn More, and then back to Discovery.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.chrisyin.com/static/fanhattan-discovery.png" alt="Discovery" /></p>

<p><strong>Discovery</strong></p>

<p>The Discovery section is currently broken into 7 horizontal panes in the top half of the screen. The panes are Smart Browse, Featured, Streaming, In Theatres, My Movies, My Friends, and Genre.</p>

<p>7 panes is a lot to swipe through. And a few overlap, so we can consolidate. Smart Browse can already filter by Genre, so no need for a standalone Genre pane. In addition, My Movies is 3 personal lists; let’s make it all part of a dropdown menu associated with the “Me” button at the top (currently useless). Finally, Featured/Streaming/My Friends all help users discover films. Let’s group those together and call it Discover. We end up with 3 simple panes—Smart Browse, Discover, and In Theatres.</p>

<p>Since Discover is now 3 panes in 1, we need to reorganize it. In a recent <a href="http://bit.ly/PmcZW0">press release</a>, Chris Thun noted that discovery is 3 things—algorithmic, curated, and social. And it makes sense; the user starts with a large list of movies, and it gets more personalized as you move from algorithmic to curated, and then even more with social. Let’s reorganize the new Discovery category to reflect this.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.chrisyin.com/static/fanhattan-pyramid.png" alt="Pyramid" /></p>

<ol>
<li>Start with most general– the 1st filter should be All.</li>

<li>Most of the Streaming pane is new material. Group it into a filter called New. (Hulu/Amazon/Free can all be filtered in Smart Browse already)</li>

<li>Add Popular– for movies trending amongst all users.</li>

<li>Re-label featured as Recommended. Take what the user likes and show similar films.</li>

<li>Last is Social, which is the currently the My Friends pane.</li>
</ol>

<p>Keep Smart Browse the same (it’s awesome), and re-sort In Theatres the same way we did Discover, from general to customized. We end up with something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.chrisyin.com/static/fanhattan1.png" alt="Fanhattan1" /></p>

<p>Just 3 panes for Discovery. Browse. Discover, from general films down to user specific. In Theatres for up &amp; coming. The same material, but no swiping, easy to navigate &amp; understand.</p>

<p>Also, when we tap on movie posters, Watch List, Seen It, Be a Fan options pop up. Let’s add Watch Now at the top so the user can immediately perform an Action when they see a film they like.</p>

<p><strong>Intrigued</strong></p>

<p>If the user is unsure, they tap the movie poster and move to the Intrigued section. Currently for Intrigued, the bottom half of the screen turns into 3 columns (Photos, Watch Now, Movie Details). Tapping Discover pulls up a new screen (Learn More) with 9 separate panes (the first 3 panes are exactly the same as the columns in Intrigued).</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.chrisyin.com/static/fanhattan-intrigued.png" alt="Intrigued" /></p>

<p>The user didn’t perform an Action in Discovery, and came to Intrigued to help with their decision. However, the current setup doesn’t help me make a decision – I need a bit more. And tapping any of these columns simply brings me to to the same pane in Learn More (and tapping the rating brings me to Movie Details)</p>

<p>Unless I was already prepared to perform an action, my decision ends up taking place in Learn More, rendering the Intrigued section almost useless.</p>

<p>The basic info I need is Summary, Cast &amp; Crew, Ratings, &amp; Trailers. Combine all the panes together, info on the left, actions on the right. Each section (Poster, Ratings, Plot Summary, Cast) should open a new window when tapped (ie tapping the critics/viewer meters will bring up the Reviews window). The user now has the requisite info and is led to perform an Action, or go back to the Discovery stage.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.chrisyin.com/static/fanhattan-2.png" alt="Fanhattan2" /></p>

<p><strong>Learn More</strong></p>

<p>At this point, we’ve provided all the basic info a user needs to make a decision. So either the user really wants to know the the film before they perform an Action or the user has already watched the film and wants to learn more. By swiping to the right, the user moves to Learn More. Here the user can get click on News, Discussions (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/ThereWillBeBloodMovie">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/?q=there+will+be+blood&src=typd">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://getglue.com/movies/there_will_be_blood/paul_anderson">GetGlue</a>, etc), or watch Clips (<a href="http://movieclips.com/">MovieClips</a>).</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.chrisyin.com/static/fanattan-learnmore.png" alt="LearnMore" /></p>

<p>For the user who is still trying to make a decision, this window will tell them everything to actually watching the film. There is no more information we can provide– the user will now either perform an Action (Watch Now in the top right), or reject the movie and go back to Discovery (click off the window).</p>

<p>The user who has already seen the film and wants to learn more has already performed an Action; we want to lead them back to Discovery. If they come this far for news/discussions/clips, I think it is safe to assume they at least mildly enjoyed the film. The user can then slide to the right and see an entire window of related films (categorized by Genre/Actors/Directors, etc) and this leads them back to the Discovery stage.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.chrisyin.com/static/fanhattan-related.png" alt="Related" /></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The user now consistently gains more info at every stage (Discovery, Intrigued, Learn More) and can perform an action at every step. And at the end, we lead them back to Discovery to start the cycle over, creating a continually engaging experience.</p>

<p>Overall, Fanhattan is still amazing – just my 2 cents.</p></p>
