    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>Stumbled across this a few days ago. Really good stuff, so wanted to re-post it.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Know what you want. Clarity is power. And vague goals promote vague results.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Remember that every problem has a solution. Maybe you just can’t see it. Yet.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In this Age of Dramatic Distraction, the performer who focuses the best wins the most.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Before someone will help you, you need to help them.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Become the most passionate person you know. It’ll be contagious.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Know more about your craft/the work you do than anyone who has ever done the work you do…in the history of the world.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Join The 5 am Club. Your most valuable hours are 5am-8am. They have the least interruptions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Devote yourself to learning something new about your field of mastery every day. Success belongs to the relentless learners. Because as you know more, you can achieve more.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Remember that when you transform your fitness, you’ll transform your business.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Don’t check your mobile when you’re meeting with another person. It’s rude. And rude people don’t reach world-class.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Every time you do what scares you, you take back the power that you gave to the thing that scared you. And so you become more powerful.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A problem is only a problem if you make the choice to see it as a problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Stop being a victim. Your business and personal life was made by you. No one else is responsible. To make it better, make better choices. And new decisions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You can lead without a title. Don’t wait to get a position to stand for excellence, peak quality and overdelivery on every expectation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Find your own style. Be an original. Every superstar differentiated themselves from The Herd. And marched to their own drumbeat.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Understand that when you play small with your success, you betray your potential. And the birthright you were born under.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Eat less food and you’ll get more done.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As you become more successful, stay really really hungry. Nothing fails like success. Because when you’re successful, it’s easy to stop outlearning+outOverDelivering+outthinking and outexecuting everyone around you. (Success is Beautiful. And dangerous).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you’re not overprepared, you’re underprepared.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The only level of great manners to play at is “Exceedingly Polite”. In our world, this alone will make you a standout. And differentiate you in your marketplace.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Remember that the moment you think you’re a Master, you lose your Mastery. And the minute you think you know everything, you know nothing.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To double your results, double your level of execution.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Invest in your personal and pro development. All superstars do.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Get this year’s best Targets of Opportunity down onto a 1 Page Plan. Then review it every morning while the rest of the world sleeps.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You don’t get lucky. You create lucky.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When you push through a difficult project, you don’t get to the other side. You reach The Next Level.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Smile. And remember to inform your face.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Spend time in solitude every day. Your best ideas live there.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Debrief on how you lived out your day every night in a journal. This will not only record your personal history, it will make you uber-clear on what you’re doing right and what needs to be improved.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If your not being criticized a lot, you’re not doing very much. Ridicule is the price of ambition.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Develop a monomaniacal focus on just a few things. The secret to productivity is simplicity.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To get the results very few people have, be strong enough to do what very few people are willing to do.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Rest. Recover. It’ll make you stronger.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Buy a smaller TV and build a larger library.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Remember that the bigger the goal, the stronger a person you must become to achieve that goal. So goal-achieving is a superb practice for character-building.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Food fuels your body. Learning feeds your mind.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Don’t ask for respect. Earn it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Finish what you start. And always end strong.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Breathe.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In business, don’t play to survive. Play to win.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Protect your good name. It’s your best asset.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Remember that words have power. Use the language of leadership versus the vocabulary of a victim.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Give more than you take. The marketplace rewards generosity.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Know that if it’s not messy, you’re not making progress.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Be a hero to a kid.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In business, aim for iconic. Go for legendary. Make history by how awesome you are at what you do.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Please don’t confuse activity with productivity. Many many people are simply busy being busy.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Your doubts are liars. Your fears are traitors. Stop buying the goods they are attempting to sell you.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The best anti-aging remedy in the world is working really hard.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>World-Class performers have no plan B. Failure just isn’t an option.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You have the power to change the world—one brave act and one person at a time. Please use it.</p>
