    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>Over the last few months I’ve been in a depression.</p>

<p>Not a mental depression, but a depression in regards to personal development.</p>

<p>I define personal development as doing things that you enjoy working on in your free time. Not just anything, but things you actively work on to get better at without any external motivation to do so.</p>

<p>Recently I’ve spent all of my time working on my day job instead of taking the time to do any personal development. Things like reading, writing, or working on personal side projects that don’t make any money :).</p>

<p>By spending all of my time working, I’m actually getting worse at work. And I’m not getting any better at my personal interests. Doubly bad.</p>
<hr />
<p>It’s easy to get sucked into work. They pay you. Projects are handed to you. You feel productive when you work on something. You know what you have to deliver. Strategy and goals are set for you – you just have to execute. Things are relatively straightforward.</p>

<p>Too often these factors lead people to spend all of time working. With non-stop work emails as the new norm and every email marked as <em>URGENT!!!</em>, it’s easy to feel like it’s irresponsible to do anything other than work.</p>

<p>The problem with constant working is that while you might feel like you’re being productive, you’re only making incremental improvements. By constantly working on the same thing – you close your mind and limit your ability to think and grow.</p>

<p>In order to innovate and make real strides in your career/ life, it’s essential to lift yourself out of the day to day tactical work and just <em>do other things</em>. Finish a book, write a blog post, volunteer, or work on a side project. Get out of the building.</p>

<p>By spending time applying your mind to other problems, you can learn and draw inspiration from outside. When you are focused on 1 problem, you develop tunnel vision. Your thinking narrows, and your thoughts can get boxed in. When you venture outside and let go, you’re able to re-open your mind and see things in a novel way.</p>

<p>Outside of work, by developing other skills, you simply become a more valuable person. You learn new skill set, open your mind, and become a much more versatile thinker.</p>

<p>As a personal anecdote, I’ve found my best ideas come from moments where my mind is farthest from the problem at hand. If I get stuck on something, I’ll start writing a post or start working on a side project and the answer serendipitously strikes me.</p>

<p>The difficulty for me is finding the right balance. I’m particularly fond of the way Jeff Atwood describes it in his post, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/03/sharpening-the-saw.html">Sharpening the Saw</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A guy who stumbled into a lumberjack. The lumberjack is feverishly sawing at a very large tree. The lumberjack was sawing and sawing, yet going nowhere. The saw was about as sharp as a butter knife. So, he says to the lumberjack, “I couldn’t help noticing how hard you are working on that tree, but going nowhere.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The lumberjack replies with sweat dripping off of his brow, “Yes…I know.” The bystander replies and says, “But your saw is so dull that it couldn’t possibly cut through anything.” “I know”, says the lumberjack, “but I am too busy sawing to take time to sharpen my saw.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure if the post is meant to be read this way – but to me, working is the tactical action of sawing away at the tree. Personal development is the act of sharpening the saw. In order to maximize your efficiency, you must find a balance between the two.</p>

<p>Constantly re-assess yourself, and be ruthlessly intellectually honest. Spend too much time sawing away and you never make a real impact. Spend too much time sharpening the saw, and you never get anywhere.</p>

<p>So force yourself to take time and do other things. Especially in startup, it can be hard to pry yourself away from all of the critical things happening. But make sure to take time every day or at least every week to let go of work and focus on building your own personal skill set and interests. You will end up serving not only your company, but also yourself much better in the long run.</p>"/>
