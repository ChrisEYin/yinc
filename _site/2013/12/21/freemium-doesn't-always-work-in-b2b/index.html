<p>For startups, the business space may seem like a gold mine. There are problems everywhere you look, customers will pay you to fix them, and there’s not millions of other startups competing with you.</p>

<p>While these attributes can make the business space attractive, not all problems are applicable to every business. Entrepreneurs must understand the types of problems they are solving in relation to the priorities of the companies they’re targeting.</p>
<hr />
<p>Companies are filled with problems. Productivity, collaboration, operations, hiring, legal, sales, support, etc. But depending on the stage of the business – early, growth, pre-IPO, public, etc. – each one will have different priorities (in regards to problems that need to be solved).</p>

<p>For instance, take an early stage company – their focus may be marketing &amp; sales. In this case, the priority is to find a solution to help them manage deals. A growth stage company’s main focus may be managing support – so they’ll be looking for a support tool. And so on.</p>

<p>So to determine if a problem fits a company’s stage, simply ask – is this a C-level problem? C-level issues are problems important enough that a CEO/exec will prioritize it. Usually only then will it get solved in a timely manner; otherwise, it may not get solved in a time frame that you can stomach (or afford).</p>
<hr />
<p>At <a href="http://tcrn.ch/18MuCue">Xpenser</a> &amp; <a href="http://tcrn.ch/18Muzyn">Coupa</a>, we made and sold an expense management solution – a web/mobile app that helped companies create, approve and reimburse their employees’ expense reports. More than making it easier for employees to capture their expenses &amp; get reimbursed, our software streamlines the reimbursement process – helping companies reduce the operational cost of processing and managing lots of expense reports.</p>

<p>Since our solution reduces cost, we have to target companies whose priority is cost reduction. Typically smaller companies are more focused on the top line (sales), while larger companies can also focus on the bottom line (cost).</p>

<p>To get these large enterprises, our strategy (product, sales, marketing) has to reflect how they buy software – through RFP’s, direct sales, analyst reports, etc. We need an enterprise roadmap, the right messaging, and an enterprise sales team in order to maximize our ROI.</p>

<p>Our previous model – freemium/bottom up – was not the most effective way to reach our customer. While we aimed for large deals, this model attracted consumers and SMB’s – because the freemium model was akin to how consumers/SMB’s bought software, not how large companies bought software.</p>

<p>And for many of the SMB’s that we did engage – they sale either dragged on for too long or eventually petered out – because even though we had gotten into the business, that particular problem wasn’t a C-level problem or a business priority. Our strategy didn’t match our target customer’s stage or how they bought software.</p>

<p>So before you take the popular sentiment of building a freemium SaaS, make sure you understand the problem you’re solving and what stage of company is interested – and then build your strategy around that.</p>"/>
