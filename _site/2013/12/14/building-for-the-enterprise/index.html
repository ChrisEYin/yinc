    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>A little over a year ago, I joined <a href="http://tcrn.ch/18MuCue">Xpenser</a> – a startup building expense management tools for businesses and individuals. We were 4 years old, bootstrapped, small (3 full time + interns), ~85K users and ~150 paying customers.</p>

<p>It was my first time building for businesses. I studied and learned about building product for companies, how to sell, marketing, support, scaling, recruiting, etc.</p>

<p>About 6 months later, we were acquired by <a href="http://tcrn.ch/18Muzyn">Coupa</a>, a spend management company, to help run &amp; build upon their existing expense management business.</p>

<p>After we started at Coupa, I thought I’d be doing the same thing I was doing at Xpenser, but just at a different company. The setting would be different, but the goals were the same – build the best expense management solution for the businesses. At the time we joined, Coupa was 6 years old, had raised ~$50M in venture capital, ~150 people, and 400+ paying customers.</p>

<p>I was wrong. Even though both times we were solving the same problem &amp; selling to companies, the lessons I learned didn’t apply universally. At Xpenser we were selling to businesses; at Coupa, we were selling to the enterprise.</p>
<hr />
<p>As a student of the startup game, both times (at Xpenser &amp; Coupa) I went to the web to learn from founders/entrepreneurs. Both times I found little helpful information, and in many cases, what I did find turned out to just be plain wrong.</p>

<p>The majority of startup advice I found on the web was directed at consumer startups. And that made sense – for a startup whose customers are other businesses, you don’t want to keep gushing your mistakes in a public forum. That kind of information will kill you in a sale. Opacity and boilerplate press releases were safer than honest blog posts.</p>

<p>So it’s hard to find good information on the web for startups to learn about building for businesses. For what I did find – there seemed to be a general misconception – B2B does not always mean enterprise. There is some gray area, but for the most part, there is a distinction between building for businesses and buidling for the enterprise. There are difference, and those differences should shape your strategy.</p>

<p>After serving and building for all types of businesses at both Xpenser &amp; Coupa, I’ve learned a bit about the space, and I’ll be sharing what I’ve learned here. <a href="http://eepurl.com/DdF7n">Click here to subscribe</a>!</p>"/>
