    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>People don’t like paying for software. Despite being incredibly cheap relative to how much value it provides, most people still gawk at the idea of paying for a $.99 app (or any software). Why?</p>

<p>I was thinking about this after reading Hunter Walk’s recent post, <a href="http://hunterwalk.com/2014/04/24/why-wont-consumers-pay-for-productivity-apps/">‘Why won’t consumers pay for productivity apps?’</a>. His point – consumer productivity software might fare better if they exposed metrics about the value they were providing – ie. how much time they saved you, how many emails they sent for you, etc.</p>

<p>I was shocked to see most commenters either agreeing or pointing to other examples of productivity software that smartly did this. While they weren’t wrong – it probably would be helpful if productivity software promoted their metrics more – they were all missing the point entirely.</p>

<p>The point is that consumers not only don’t care about productivity, they also value money &gt; time.</p>

<p>When we look at the average consumer’s behavior, they’re not focused on productivity. Consumers either are either home after a long day at work or they’re hanging out with friends on the weekend. They’re thinking about relaxing, taking it easy, and enjoying themselves. Productivity is not a high priority for the consumer (I wrote about solving <a href="http://www.chrisyin.com/2013/12/21/freemium-doesn%27t-always-work-in-b2b/">the right priorities here</a>). That’s why you see most successful consumer applications geared towards leisure – Facebook, Instagram, Yelp, etc. Productivity doesn’t fit here.</p>

<p>Also, the average consumer values money much more than their own time. Since there are no explicit tasks/agenda for them, they value their own time at $0.00. So many things are more valuable than their time (esp. money). So trying to monetize consumer productivity is an uphill battle – also why popular consumer apps are free and ad supported as opposed to subscription based.</p>

<p>All productivity software either starts as pure B2B or eventually leans and focuses on the B2B market. Because the product matches the buyers intent, that’s where the money is.</p>
<hr />
<p>As a footnote, I’ll say that I do think that as time goes on, we’ll have an increase in the number of consumers that value time &gt; money and are willing to pay for software. But we still have a long way to go, and I’m unsure if this will ever be the predominant consumer mentality – I simply believe that this consumer group is increasing in size.</p>"/>
