    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>Over the last year, have been working on a small side project to help people understand movies/tv shows better. A lot of times after I watch something, I’ll lurk on Wikipedia/IMDB/Reddit etc to find answers to any outstanding questions. Sometimes just I’ll casually float around the web to revisit some of the scenes, discover any subtleties I may have missed, or just talk about how awesome/shitty something was. Some notable times I’ve done this – after <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/faq">Inception</a>, <a href="http://www.prometheus2-movie.com/community/forums/42">Prometheus</a>, and after every <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad">Breaking Bad</a> episode in the second half of Season 5.</p>

<p>I would spend a fair amount of time collecting bits of information from around the web, consolidating it into my mind to form a cohesive story, explain it to a friend, and then I’d be satisfied. But it was a massive time suck and an enormous pain in the ass. To find the info I’d have to scour the web – on one end, going through generic synopses on Wikipedia (usually really high level and poorly written) and then all the way down to crawling through IMDB boards/Reddit (essentially internet forums – and we know how these are. Have to wade through tons of shit to hopefully find 1 nugget of good info).</p>

<p>To get any real answers/insight into questions, some serious internet investigation would have to take place. Sometimes you’d find a decent answer on Wikipedia, follow it up with a good comment in Reddit, then have to read someone’s take on a random blog post. Once again – a massive pain in the ass, and it wasn’t easy to share the end result with other people.</p>

<p>With a friend, I decided to build a new way to do this. We’re on V2 now, but in the meantime – to quickly test the general thesis of this idea (do people even care about reading more into film/tv shows?), I did an annotation of <a href="http://bit.ly/1dwjTCc">“The Godfather”</a> on <a href="http://poetry.rapgenius.com/">PoetryGenius</a> &amp; shared with the <a href="http://poetry.rapgenius.com/tv-movie-genius">RapGenius</a> community. The response was pretty awesome – got a lot of comments, messages, feedback, and views pretty quickly. Even floated over to popular posts on the home page for some time.</p>

<p>Overall, it was pretty cool to share the annotation with other people and see other people care about it. The annotation style on Rapgenius is not exactly how I imagine this working, but it’s close enough for a quick test. Going to continue working to finish V2, but in the meantime will do a few more types of annotations and share to see if it continues to resonate.</p>
