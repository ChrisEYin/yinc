<p>Everyone does it. It’s especially tempting to sell roadmap when you’re early in the game and you need the customers/revenue to gain some traction. But at some point you need to stop.</p>

<p>Every time you sell engineering bandwidth, you incur some debt. The business continues forward, but development lingers behind trying to fulfill the promises. Eventually the delta gets very large, and you’ve got a real problem.</p>

<p>There’s 2 big problems with selling features/roadmap -</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>It’s hard to keep track of. Building features is not just development - there’s lots of hidden costs outside of pure development. Which means the estimates (especially those made during a sales cycle) are frequently incorrect. These backlogged items are very hard to keep track of and can build up very quickly. Before you know it, you can be backlogged for a very long time, derailing your entire product strategy and roadmap.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Sales can develop a habit of relying on this. When sales begins relying on selling promised features instead of product, it’s no longer a value sell. It becomes a feature/function war, and the customer will view you as a commodity instead of valued partner - meaning you’re replaceable.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s not easy and it takes discipline as an organization, but in order to build a scaleable business with a solid foundation, you have to rely on selling a solution, and not features of a product. Especially ones that don’t exist yet.</p>"/>
