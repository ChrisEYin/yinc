    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>Recently I’ve been seeing more and more ‘personal assistant’ scheduling products coming out, touting the ability to relieve you of wasted time scheduling meetings.</p>

<p>Ostensibly these products were built and designed to make money at some point. As a consumer, I use calendaring infrequently – occasional get togethers, errands, etc. Not enough to spend money on a service. The bulk of calendar pain is work related – so these products must be targeted at a business audience.</p>

<p>If that’s true, the apps today are missing the mark. The majority of the apps I’ve tried function the same way – cc an alias and they’ll help you schedule a meeting. What they don’t mention is that they’re really optimized for basic meetings (1:1, immediate scheduling, etc).</p>

<p>The pain is not around basic meetings – it’s around the complex ones. Coordinating between multiple people. Multiple time zones. Adding a conference call dial in to every meeting. Then cancelling and rescheduling.</p>

<p>These products fail under the strain of complex meetings. Either a delay in response (invites never show up) or just silently failing. That type of slip or delay at work can be extremely costly. There is little room &amp; patience for error – and when ~85% of meetings are complex, the supposed benefits of the product are quickly overshadowed by its shortcomings.</p>

<p>Now, I realize that many of these products are early stage and MVP’s. However - either they didn’t fully understand the problem or their MVP is coming up short. An MVP is the shortest &amp; quickest path to prove out a solution. These products have proved the existence of a problem, but not a solution.</p>

<p>In my eyes, an MVP for this type of product is at a minimum - multiple person scheduling, possibly automated conf call dial ins in the invite. A V2 (possibly a paid version, leaving the base product free) is the ability to configure personal preferences. ie for me – no calls on Tuesdays, prefer to take them from 2-6pm PT. Another element is factoring in meeting priority and rescheduling and reprioritizing based on that.</p>

<p>While I’m confident we’ll get there eventually, the early incarnations of the software’s shortcomings and frustrations are far greater than value add.</p>"/>
