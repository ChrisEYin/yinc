    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>I just got back from a 2.5 week workcation. I wanted to get out of town &amp; get some new ideas, inspiration, and soak in some culture from outside of the US. Since I have family in Taiwan, it seemed like a pretty easy &amp; low risk choice.</p>

<p>I still had to work, so I decided I’d work PT, but in Taiwan. Taiwan is 16 hours ahead (add 4 hours to PT and switch the AM/PM) – so I work from 12am-9am in Taiwan (8am-5pm PT). Sleep from 11am-6pm, work on side projects until 12am and then back to Coupa work. Weekends were mine.</p>

<p><img src="/images/taiwan.jpg" alt="taiwan" /></p>

<p>Overall, Taiwan was awesome. The food there is amazing – cheap, fast, delicious, and everywhere. Transportation is fast and readily available. People are really friendly. Altogether, it was really fun &amp; interesting to see the differences between their society and ours.</p>

<p>Lots of things stood out, but 2 things that really impressed me were the transportation and the self-serve culture.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Transportation</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned above, getting around was really easy – and a better overall experience than anything I’ve dealt with in America. There are cabs &amp; buses everywhere – you can flag a cab anywhere at any time in under a minute. Plus the bus has a free app that will send you a push notification when it’s close. Really nice, the first implementation I’ve seen of ‘objects talking to objects’. Pretty awesome.</p>

<p><img src="/images/taiwan-mrt.jpg" alt="mrt" /></p>

<p>But the real winner in Taiwanese transportation is the subway system. Cheap, fast, on time, and clean. What’s really amazing is the card. You get a plastic card that you load with money – you tap it against a terminal to get in, and tap again to get out. So much better than swipe or insert ticket – pretty small detail, but made everything just that much easier &amp; faster.</p>

<p>Now, the really nice thing about this card is the integration of this card with the rest of Taiwan. You can use it at any 7-11/corner store (these are everywhere – often multiple on a single block). It’s also getting integrated into apartments. Meaning your subway card can get you around town, buy food, and open your house door. So awesome.</p>

<p><img src="/images/taipei-mrt-easy-card.JPG" alt="mrtcard" /></p>

<p>Overall, getting around in Taiwan is just easy. And you only need a single card to leave the house.</p>

<p>Bonus – Taiwan also has a bunch of public bike racks around town that you can check out and ride around. It’s free for the first 30 minutes, and there’s a corresponding app that tells you where they are, where you can park, etc. And to check a bike out, you just need to use your subway card.</p>

<p><img src="/images/taiwan-bike.jpg" alt="taiwanbike" /></p>

<p><strong>Self Serve Culture</strong></p>

<p>Outside of transportation, one of the major differences that I noticed between Taiwan and America was an inherent culture of self serve. Everything and everyone seemed to be very self contained and respectful of their surroundings.</p>

<p><img src="/images/taipei-fish-market.jpg" alt="fishmarket" /></p>

<p>When you walk into a restaurant, you seat yourself. You don’t get offered water. You grab the menu yourself. If you want to order, you go up and order. This pattern was everywhere – food, shopping, etc.</p>

<p>The most prominent thing was how clean everything was. Because space is a constraint, everything is shared. Tables, chairs, personal space. And because of the volume of people, nobody cleans up after you. So everything is shared by lots of people, yet still remain clean. Sharp contrast to shared American public utilities. The biggest surprise to me was the subway – 1000’s of people getting on and off hundreds of times a day, and no litter.</p>

<p><img src="/images/taiwan-clean-mrt.jpg" alt="clean-mrt" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, my trip was great. My main takeaways – Taiwan seems to be a faster moving country than America in terms of integrating technology into mainstream life. I suspect this is a byproduct of the fact that Taiwan is much smaller; therefore, change is easier.</p>

<p>The other thing was the respect an awareness of the surrounding environment. People were largely self policing – which was pretty amazing to see at a large scale. In America we sometimes see this behavior in controlled environments, but to see the general population behave this way was cool.</p>

<p>Definitely going to return, would love to bring some of that back to America :).</p>"/>
