<p>Last week we’ve seen several once high flying companies shutting down, most notably <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/06/aereo-officially-shuts-down-operations/">Aereo</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/20/pch-international-in-talks-to-buy-fab-for-15-million/">Fab</a>, and <a href="http://recode.net/2014/11/03/rovi-buys-fantv/">FanTV</a>.</p>

<p>All these companies raised a ton of money at strong valuations. Aereo raised $97 Million at $800 Million. Fab raised $310 Million at $1 Billion. And FanTV had raised more than $40 Million.</p>

<p>Aereo is <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/06/aereo-officially-shuts-down-operations/">shutting down completely</a> after losing in court to cable companies. Fab is selling itself for <a href="http://qz.com/300825/how-fab-com-went-from-a-1-billion-valuation-to-a-15-million-fire-sale/">$15 Million</a>. And FanTV sold to Rovi for <a href="http://www.multichannel.com/news/tv-apps/rovi-paid-12m-fanhattan/385729">$12 Million</a>.</p>

<p>Although companies frequently fail, we don’t read about it much. The tech press spends most of their time celebrating product launches, fundraising, partnerships, etc. without revisiting the results. Oftentimes these announcements are the starting gun, not the finish line. Yet we celebrate them as if they are the end game.</p>

<p>I’m a strong believer that highlighting failure is incredibly important. Startups are really hard, and they need to characterized as so. Not only for educating incoming entrepreneurs, but also gives prospective entrepreneurs a glimpse of reality. It’s not all fundraising and big exits. The risk of failure is very real, and the cost is high.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another point that we can takeaway from all of this is that ultimately, business is business. Tech companies (especially software co’s) often astound people. They’re puzzled by how startups can grow so quickly and make so much money. This lack of understanding often leads people to falsely believing it’s either easy or that these companies defy reality.</p>

<p>Big failures like this bring us back to earth. At the end of the day, business is business, regardless if it’s a startup or not. You absolutely need to create a product that people want, and also have a business model to support it.</p>

<p>Fab was a standard e-commerce company – running on razor thin margins &amp; without proprietary product. Regardless, they raised raised a tremendous amount of money, seemingly defying all logic with. But in the end, the economics did not support their model.</p>

<p>While Fanhattan (<a href="/2012/09/26/fanhattan-ux-breakdown/">I wrote about their product earlier</a>) had a very beautiful product, nobody loved it &amp; they struggled with distribution. Their pivot to hardware was once again – beautifully designed but struggled with distribution. A lot of things we can learn from this one, but the key is that you can’t just create beautiful products. You need to solve a compelling problem and pair that with a strong distribution strategy.</p>

<p>And lastly Aereo was plagued with problems from the beginning. In the end, it came down to the fact that large cable companies and copyright law could still push them out of business. In the end, the courts overruled them and that was it.</p>

<p>We can learn a lot from all of these failures, and there are lots of <a href="http://ryanhoover.me/post/74229429351/14-startup-postmortems">other post mortems</a> out there for us to read. While it sucks to see these companies fall, they reinforce the point that business is business, whether you’re a startup or not. And if you’re starting up, be prepared to deal with the reality that of startup life – fighting both traditional business problems are startup ones simultaneously.</p>"/>
