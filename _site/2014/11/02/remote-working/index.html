<p>As a global company, we have a <a href="http://www.coupa.com/our-offices">several remote offices and people</a>. I used to be one of them – lived in San Diego, HQ in San Mateo. And I’ve always thought that the tools we use to bridge gap felt suboptimal. In speaking to other remote people, they feel the same way – there’s something missing for remote workers. I touched on it slightly <a href="/2014/10/01/collaboration/">here</a>.</p>

<p>While remote working is taking hold in companies, it is still feels secondary to in person working. This applies to the tools we have today – they feel like extensions of in person collaboration as opposed to being built for a remote working first organizations.</p>

<p>The tools for modern remote working are typically some means of communication and sharing. So we use Hipchat for chat, Jira as a dev tracker, Zendesk as a support tracker, Google Drive for docs/spreadsheets, Github for code, Gmail and more. An absurd number of tools, and the noise that comes out of all this is very hard to wade through.</p>

<p>When you’re getting barraged with emails, pinged on Hipchat, Jira/Zendesk tickets getting assigned to you – it’s nearly impossible to figure out what is important and what is not. These tools facilitate one to many communication – leading to a tendency to spam people. Safer to add someone than not, making an already noisy workplace noisier.</p>

<p>In person, you gain context &amp; focus. Very easy to see the current context and gauge if it’s a good time to ask someone for some focused time. And if they’ve agreed, very easy to determine whether or not you’re getting it – both if it’s a 5 min sync up or an hour long session. On the web it’s not so easy to tell who’s busy or not – and if you do get their time, if they’re focused or not. This coupled with the spammy nature of our tools drives a wedge between in person workers and remotes.</p>

<p>The second missing aspect is visibility. On the web, you’re as good as your chat icon status and how you often you communicate what you’re doing. In person, people can physically see you in the office, even if they don’t talk to you. Remotely it’s much more difficult to get visibility and recognition, which is an important part of working on a team.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now I’ve seen some of these tools work in a 100% remote environment. In a 100% remote environment, everyone respects the rules of remote tools – always online, responsive, status up to date, efficient communication, etc. It works – <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/03/how-wordpress-thrives-with-a-1/">Automattic</a>, <a href="https://open.bufferapp.com/remote-working-means-tools-use/">Buffer</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/how-manage-remote-team/">Zapier</a> are good examples.</p>

<p>It’s when there is a mix between remotes and in person that this break down. Not everyone lives online, and so the tools aren’t being used properly. If the tools fail, those in person can always default to ‘I’ll catch them in the office tomorrow’. This breakes the integrity of these tools and ultimately fails remote workers.</p>

<p>I don’t have a great solution, but I do think things like <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, <a href="https://www.sqwiggle.com/">Sqwiggle</a> and <a href="https://idonethis.com/">iDoneThis</a> are on the right path. We need tools to help gain context &amp; focus (Sqwiggle does a great job of this with easy, near always on video chat) as well as a way to increase visibility (iDonethis) &amp; camraderie in our tools. The key in a mixed organization is for everyone to adopt the tools, not just remote workers.</p>"/>
