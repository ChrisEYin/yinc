<hr />
<p>When I think about collaboration tools, there are 3 things that really come to mind - mobile, distributed working, and the internet of things.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile</strong></p>

<p>When talking about short term trends in collaboration, mobile is top of mind. It’s not so much an upcoming trend, but something that is already happening. I recently wrote a post, <a href="http://www.chrisyin.com/2014/08/13/Mobile-First-in-the-Enterprise/">Mobile First in the Enterprise</a>, that talks about this. As traditional desktop software went online, we got a taste of working outside of the office. Now with mobile, we’re pushing that even further and we’re demanding high quality tools so we can do our jobs anywhere &amp; anytime.</p>

<p>Mobile is a unique form factor in that screen real estate is small, there are built in sensors not available via a browser, and simplicity/single function are dominant. Collaboration reimagined from a mobile first perspective will yield very different tools and experiences than we’re familiar with. Prescient companies are taking this very seriously, and a quick look at popular collaboration tools all treat high quality stand alone mobile apps as a base requirement.</p>

<p><strong>Distributed Working</strong></p>

<p>A related point is distributed working. As mentioned above, modern tools allow us to do quality work outside of the office. We’re pushing this further than we have before with distributed or remote working. As commonly said, there is more talent outside of your locale than in it. And although companies have been adopting this mentality, the tools for distributed working still feel second rate. Lots of these tools help remote teams contribute and communicate, but they feel like individualized solutions under a bigger problem.</p>

<p>Better ways of sharing knowledge, documents, code, etc are certainly important, but another aspect that has been largely ignored is the culture and team building around remote workers. The available tools don’t facilitate and capture the same effect as in person work - the camaraderie, teamwork, excitement, visibility, and other culture building things. These are still largely solved from in person visits and spending time with each other. I’m looking forward to tools and solutions that are built for distributed teams first, and not tools to just help remote teams better contribute to those working in person.</p>

<p><strong>Connected Devices</strong></p>

<p>The last trend that I think is really important is the Internet of Things. I’m a bit a averse to that phrase as it’s been a bit overused, but I am genuinely excited for the notion of ‘devices talking to devices’. While software has greatly improved in general, what has not dramatically improved is how we interact with software - input has and continues to be manual. We still have to manually type details into Salesforce, type your receipts into a system to create expense reports, etc.</p>

<p>With the advent of smartphones coupled with the declining cost of sensors, we’re getting a taste of what life is like with sensors embedded everywhere, capturing and inputting data in for us. A small example of this is something I noticed in Taiwan - inbound buses auto send notifications about arrival time to those in the proximity of the bus stop. That’s a small example of what can be done when devices talk to other devices, and if we think about this and apply it in a workplace setting, amazing solutions can then be created – ie auto logging details of a call into Salesforce, context sensitive time tracking tools, automatically creating/prioritizing/closing tasks on a todo list, and lots of other things that I haven’t even thought of.</p>"/>
