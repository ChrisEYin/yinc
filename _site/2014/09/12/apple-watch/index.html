<p>The Apple watch was just announced a few days ago. Some reviews good, some bad. Regardless, it’s Apple, so the watch will sell. That being said, it is a V1 and there’s a lot of work left for them to do.</p>

<p>The product itself looked good. The software looked nice and the watch as a fitness tracker is the obvious but really great use case. The interchangeable bands are also a nice addition. The interface felt a bit strange though – not sure if tons of tiny icons on a home screen works well. And while I personally don’t like the dial, it makes sense.</p>

<p>The one thing that felt a bit weird to me was the presentation &amp; the video. It showed Apple Watch doing everything. Texting, heartbeat, movies, calls, showing thousands of pictures, etc. All on this tiny device.</p>

<p>Given that it’s a V1 and still an emerging product category, the use cases are not clearly defined yet. The leading question from everyone was – why do I need one?</p>

<p>At this point, the Apple Watch (or any smart watch) is an extension of the device in your pocket – not standalone. It is a complement and should enhance some use cases, but not all.</p>

<p>Meaning - it can’t do everything a smartphone can. And it shouldn’t have to. The watch should be framed as a complement and an enhancement. Therefore the specific use cases should be well defined and displayed as such. They should show what it can do really well, and not just show all of the things that it can do.</p>

<p>Regardless, I do think that Apple will nail down those use cases and work it through. The device will get thinner, the use cases will become more defined, and the product will improve. So I’m absolutely long Apple Watch, just wanted to see better defined use cases.</p>"/>
