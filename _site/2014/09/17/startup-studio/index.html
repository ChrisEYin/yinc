    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>The startup studio. Every entrepreneur I know dreams about building a startup studio, myself included.</p>

<p>A startup studio is simply an umbrella organization grouping together a set of ideas &amp; products. What’s great about the studio model is that you’re not tied to any 1 thing like a company is. You’re not constrained to any particular sector, idea, product, etc. – you’re starting with nothing but some general hypotheses, and you can go in any direction you like.</p>

<p>What’s awesome about this is the experimental nature of the startup studio. You can explore a variety of ideas at once that can be unrelated or even conflicting – and quickly start/kill any of them at any time. You’re free to think, explore, and learn much faster than you would ordinarily.</p>

<p>Startups are hard and scary. In many cases, the end result of a startup has very little to do with the original idea. So the studio model lets you explore and experiement. If you have some inclination, you build &amp; test it. If something isn’t working, you put it to rest and take your lessons. And if something works, you can spin it out and push it further.</p>

<p>What I love about this is the freedom to practice and exercise the 0 → 1 muscle. <a href="http://blakemasters.com/post/20400301508/cs183class1">As Peter Thiel has noted</a>, 0 → 1 is the most difficult stage of building companies, but also the most fun and exciting. And I would love to spend my time focused on that.</p>

<p>The retort that I hear from people is about a seeming lack of results &amp; focus. If we look at the existing ones – <a href="http://betaworks.com/">Betaworks</a>, <a href="http://expa.com/">Expa</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/obvious">Obvious</a>, <a href="http://www.n-o-r-t-h-t-e-c-h-n-o-l-o-g-i-e-s.com/">North</a>, <a href="http://www.hvflabs.com/">HVF</a>, and even <a href="https://www.rocket-internet.com/">Rocket Internet</a> – there is a consistnent thesis behind every studio. And some great companies have already been built from these groups.</p>

<p>And it’s fairly early still in the lifetime of these studios, so we’ll see in a few years how they fair. But the results so far look good.</p>
