<p>Technology is about <a href="https://medium.com/according-to-pmarca/how-new-technologies-enhance-human-capabilities-a4de8e4beeac">giving human beings superpowers</a>. Early computers were tools that helped people perform basic tasks faster and also remember large sets of data. They were awesome for basic processing, storage and retrieval – but those abilities were tied to a local machine.</p>

<p>Then came the internet. Storage &amp; retrieval coupled with the distribution of the internet gave us incredible reach and access. We could easily share, distribute and retrieve group knowledge - making us smarter, more connected, etc. But we were still tethered to a computer for this - until mobile. Now everyone has all of this magic in their pocket with them everywhere they go.</p>

<p>Software &amp; technology has continually gotten better over the years and we can now easily store, share &amp; access data anywhere, anytime. But what hasn’t materially changed much is the way we collect and input data. Most data is still collected by a person typing things in via a keyboard.</p>

<p>The iPhone gave us a taste of what life would be like with sensors embedded in our lives - collecting data and doing the input for us (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/socialtech/20-hot-locationbased-apps-and-services-you-should-know-about-12841489">GPS</a>, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/the-best-apps-that-use-your-phones-boring-features-in-710672640">accelerometer</a>, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2455474/open-sesame-how-ios-8-will-unlock-touch-ids-power.html">fingerprint</a>). We’re already seeing companies today leveraging these sensors top build awesome products like <a href="https://nest.com/">Nest</a>, <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a>, <a href="http://estimote.com/">Estimote</a>, etc.</p>

<p>As the cost of sensors continues to go down, they will continue to permeate everyday life. <a href="http://chrisyin.com/2014/03/12/taiwan-workcation/">In another post</a> I mentioned that in Taiwan as the bus gets close to the stop, it sends push notifications to users that are in the vicinity. That’s awesome, and just a tiny example of what is possible here.</p>

<p>So I’m really excited for everything around us to be connected &amp; help us to collect data and transmit it. The benefits will be enormous, and we will see tons of revolutionary technologies that automate and improve our lives over the next few years.</p>"/>
