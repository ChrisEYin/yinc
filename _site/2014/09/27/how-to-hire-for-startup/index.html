    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>Hiring at startups is hard. Startups are a small group of people trying to be super productive and get a lot of shit done. You’re low on money, low on time, and the people you need are getting wooed by other startups or large companies.</p>

<p>So you have to be efficient in finding good people. Recruiting is a huge time suck, but hiring the wrong people &amp; firing is a much more costly exercise, so you have to do your best to be precise.</p>

<p>But what is good and how do you find out?</p>

<p>The simplest way I’ve found to explain this is – good people are intellectual curious, focused on results, and always striving for excellence.</p>

<p>These things are hard to find in a short inteview. These 3 questions do a decent job </p>

<ol>
<li>Tell me your story</li>

<li>Give me the 1 thing you suck at</li>

<li>Explain something to me that you care about.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most of the stuff I hear in startup interviews don’t matter. Domain experience is nice, technical trivia can be necessary, but all that really matters is somebody has the right instincts, knows how to learn, and takes ownership.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tell me your story. This helps you learn someone’s journey and their decisions over the long term. What you want is an understanding of someone’s innate intellectual curiosity and how those translate into actions and results. People who are curious about things will pursue them, and those will manifest themselves classes they took, side projects, career choices, and mostly importantly, success stories.</p>

<p>The second question is about striving for excellence. It’s similar to the strengths &amp; weaknesses question, but is more focused – I want to know about the one thing that you think you’re not good at, why you think you’re not good at it, and what are you doing to fix it. Shows focus, introspection, intellectual honestly, and the drive to become better.</p>

<p>Lastly, explain something to me, shamelessly stolen from <a href="https://twitter.com/parand">Parand</a>. The question makes a lot of people uncomfortable, but gives you so much information about somebody. Who they are as a person (it’s usually something personal), what they’re passionate about, but most important – you get an understanding of how someone communicates and thinks. I won’t provide too much more detail here, but try this next time and would leave to hear what you take away from this in the commments.</p>

<p>What about you? Any other great questions or things you look for? Would love to hear in the comments.</p>"/>
