    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>There’s been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/23/secret-cyberbullying/">a lot of talk</a> <a href="http://www.bustle.com/articles/34337-bullying-is-a-problem-for-all-of-us-and-the-app-secret-needs-to-do-something">recently</a> about anonymity. Some, <a href="http://pando.com/2014/08/03/now-weve-seen-secrets-ugly-soul-will-investors-act/">like Pando</a>, are claiming that anonymity is horrific and companies like Secret are not only morally bankrupt, but also enabling online bullying. While that position feels a bit strong to me, I do think there is some truth to what is being said.</p>

<p>Historically, the web has been an anonymous place. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan#Media_attention">4chan</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formspring#Controversies">Formspring</a>, Myspace – everything was anonymous. There was no sense of identity on the web and these places ended up being really toxic – known for lies, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/bulle/2010/03/how_should_facebook_and_myspace_handle_cyberbullying.html">bullying</a>, and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/17/4740902/no-good-answers-why-didnt-ask-fm-learn-from-the-formspring-suicides">even suicides</a>.</p>

<p>Then Facebook came to exist, and while there were likely sites before Facebook that were centered around real identity on the web, Facebook was the first to really take off. This cemented the idea that we should use our real identities on the web, and the next batch of companies followed suit. The web became a much nicer place. Now that we’re dipping our toes back into anonymity, it’s clear that not much has changed from the earlier days.</p>

<p>Anonymity is still producing the same result as before because fundamentally people are only as nice as it is convenient for them to be. And behind a mask on the internet, that bar is pretty low.</p>

<p>Anonymity removes accountability. And without accountability, people say/do bad things. And this is not specific to the internet - this is everywhere. So applying anonymity at scale on the web is likely not a good idea at this point.</p>

<p>That’s not to say anonymity is all bad. There are certainly positives around anonymity – the obvious ones being an outlet for emotional burdens, stress, relationship issues, etc. Being able to express these feelings safely to others can do a lot of good.</p>

<p>So there’s definitely value in anonymity. But it has to be done tastefully to mitigate/eliminate the bad sides of anonymity, and it’s clear from the current implementation that we are not there yet.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now I’m always a big proponent that you shouldn’t criticize something unless you’ve got a solution. So as I’ve been thinking about how anonymity has been done well in the real world, it has lead me to groups like Alcoholics Anonymous (and other anonymous groups).</p>

<p>My impression on why these groups work well is 2 things – alignment of interests and small community. A smaller community feels like a decent way to maintain some sort of accountability in an anonymous setting. And the singular focus around a specific topic aligns the group, making it easier to self police when people stray off topic.</p>

<p>So I think in our first iteration around anonymity 2.0, we should start with similar principles – group focus around a singular topic as well as some method of accountability (not sure if limiting a group by size works here, may actually lead to more bullying, but putting place some mechanism to prevent it from being totally open).</p>"/>
