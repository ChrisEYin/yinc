<p>A few days ago <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ryangrepper/coolest-cooler-21st-century-cooler-thats-actually">Coolest Cooler</a> overtook <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android">Pebble</a> for most funded Kickstarter campaign ever. The product is really just a fancy cooler with speakers, blenders, bottle opener, etc.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/15/the-5-million-cooler/">this TechCrunch story</a>, the first comment pointed out that the real story was not about the $13M raise, but that the founder, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/ryangrepper">Ryan Grepper</a>, had run <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ryangrepper/the-coolest-cooler-with-blender-music-and-so-much/">almost the exact same campaign with the same product</a> just under a year ago and failed to close.</p>

<p>What’s awesome about this is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ryangrepper/the-coolest-cooler-with-blender-music-and-so-much/">if you look</a> at <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ryangrepper/coolest-cooler-21st-century-cooler-thats-actually">both Kickstarter pages</a>, the product did not substantial change from one campaign to the other (I’m not sure it changed at all). Some of the details on the Kickstarter page are different, but everything is pretty similar. The only difference is the outcome.</p>

<p>I have no idea what was different the 2nd time around, but what we can take from this is that perseverance through failure is what matters. Ryan obviously believed he had a winner on his hands, and he kept hustling through his 1st failure to pull together a massive success the 2nd time around.</p>

<p>I love reading about this kind of stuff, and so congrats to Ryan and his team for pulling it off.</p>"/>
