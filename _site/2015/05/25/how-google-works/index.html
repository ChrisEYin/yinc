<p>I just read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Google-Works-Eric-Schmidt/dp/1455582344">How Google Works</a>, a book about how to run and build a company in the internet age, written by <a href="https://twitter.com/jjrosenberg">Jonathan Rosenberg</a>, former SVP of Products and former CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/ericschmidt">Eric Schmidt</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the book and wanted to share some of the key points here.</p>

<p><strong>The Intenet</strong></p>

<p>Most companies that are built and run today are largely out of date. They are a relic of a pre-internet world, where information transfer was slow and products were still being ‘manufactured’ (in the traditional sense).</p>

<p>Historically, information was hoarded by whoever had it (usually at the top). Manufacturing products was a slow &amp; expensive process — meaning the cost of failure was high. This forced companies to design processes around a few key decison makers in order to slow things down and mitigate risk. Meaning companies were designed to be slow.</p>

<p>But with the advent of the internet, the world has changed. Information moves around freely &amp; quickly, so there is no value in hoarding it. The value is instead what you do with the information. Building products is now faster &amp; cheaper, so we have far more products today and they are better than ever.</p>

<p>Companies were designed to move slowly, but the world today is fast. So the way we build and run companies must adapt to this new world.</p>

<p><strong>Good Products</strong></p>

<p>Historically, consumers had very little choice when it came to products. Because it was expensive &amp; slow to build products, there were a limited supply of things being produced. So consumers didn’t have a ton of choice — they just took whatever they got.</p>

<p>Not only were consumers limited by choice, but there was no easy way of getting info &amp; reviews on products. So consumer education on products largely came from word of mouth and/or sales &amp; marketing. The power was in the company’s hands, and consumers could be fooled by poor products with good sales/marketing. So there was very little pressure on companies to create better products (outside of desire to beat the competition).</p>

<p>Nowadays with review sites for nearly everything, consumers can quickly learn and make educated decisions on which products are good/bad. And with more products to choose from, the cost of switching is low &amp; there’s always a new competitor out to deliver a better serivce.</p>

<p>In today’s world, bad products die fast. So every company must focus on making really good products.</p>

<p><strong>Building Good Products</strong></p>

<p>The best products do one thing better than anyone else.</p>

<p>In general, people do things either in house (internally) or outsource it (externally). People do things externally when the transaction cost of doing it internally is greater than it is to do it externally.</p>

<p>With the internet (cheaper &amp; better products), transaction costs for doing things externally continues to get lower. Meaning people are increasingly outsourcing more and more of their lives.</p>

<p>With more services in our lives, each of them just has to be really good at one thing. The best products focus on doing one thing exceptionally well and better than everyone else. Small &amp; really good services are better than large &amp; mediocre ones.</p>

<p>To do one thing really well, companies need to deeply understand the problem they’re trying to solve and always put the product &amp; end user first. Everything should be secondary to the needs of the end user. A quote I really liked was </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“You should never be able to reverse engineer a company’s organizational chart from the design of its product.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now to build the best product, there are 3 important things —</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure the product is built on a unique technical insight</li>

<li>Optimize for growth, not revenue</li>

<li>Understand the competition, but don’t follow</li>
</ol>

<p>And again, in an age where products are cheap to build, there is a shift away from heavy planning &amp; careful development to rapid iteration. Companies can learn much faster by continually building &amp; iterating than by trying to plan &amp; guess. Meaning those who build things are now much more important than those who plan things.</p>

<p><strong>On People</strong></p>

<p>The key to building great products is to find ‘smart creatives’. These are people who can combine business, art, and science to build great products.</p>

<p>Smart creatives crave working with others smart creatives and solving difficult problems. So make sure that you’re tackling sufficiently ambitious problems and hire other smart creatives to help.</p>

<p>Ultimately, smart creatives want to get things done. So make sure that they have the freedom to do so. Put them in small teams to limit politics and favor getting things done. Align them around principles as opposed to tactics and let them do the rest. They’ll do a far better job than you could.</p>"/>
