<p>No is a difficult things for most people to say. But it’s one of the most important. Out of all of the requests for your time (meetings, projects, lunch/dinner invites, etc.), the reality is – you likely only have time for ~10-20% of them. So you need to say no to 80%-90% of them. But you probably don’t.</p>

<p>The proper way to handle this is to learn how to triage quickly. You hear a request, you decide if it makes sense, and you say yes/no. Simple.</p>

<p>Now it’s easy to say no to the things that you don’t want to do. But it’s harder to say no to things that make sense, but aren’t a priority. You say yes, and then when push comes to shove, you prioritize over it and it never gets done. So you’re not lying, but you’re not being honest either.</p>

<p>This can be really hard, as a lot of things seem urgent or potentially important/valuable. So you want to at least keep your options open by saying yes. But you can’t, because that dilutes the ‘yes’. You have to say no to almost everything except what really matters.</p>

<p>This can be really tough. So the way that I’ve dealt with this is by keeping a short list of priorities (3-5). I write it down in Evernote and then make it my phone background. From there, it becomes a simple triage – when someone asks you for something, if it’s doesn’t follow one of the goals on your screen, then say no. If it does, say yes.</p>

<p>A simple framework, but I’ve found that when you follow this, you should be able to more easily say no to most things. On a quarterly basis, you should revisit these goals and your progress. Make sure you’ve accomplished something, and then set new goals for the next quarter.</p>"/>
