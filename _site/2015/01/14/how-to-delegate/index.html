    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>Following up on a previous post, <a href="/2015/01/02/on-management/">On Management</a>, is another important point – how to delegate.</p>

<p>When you’ve been with a company that has grown from small to large, the lines between what to do yourself vs what to delegate can blur.</p>

<p>At Coupa, we’ve grown from a 3 person PM team to 18 in the last 2 years. Which means now there’s people to pass the work around.</p>

<p>But it’s tough figuring out what to delegate and to what degree. In many cases, it’s easier &amp; faster to just do it yourself. However as you grow, it becomes impossible to do everything yourself, and you can find yourself going to the other extreme – delegating everything.</p>

<p>On one end you have micromanagement, and on the other end you have abdication. Both are sins. So I really liked this matrix presented by <a href="http://twitter.com/rabois">Keith Rabois</a> to help determine what to delegate.</p>

<p><img src="/images/delegate.png" alt="delegate" /></p>

<p>A clear and easy framework. The question now becomes what to do for the question marks? This is dependent not only on the task, but who you’re working with.</p>

<p>How I’ve handled it – in the top left, I tend to just set direction, advise, and follow up. For tasks in the bottom right, I’ve had to play a much more active role, setting the direction, creating the plan, following up, and juggling between doing and actively managing.</p>"/>
