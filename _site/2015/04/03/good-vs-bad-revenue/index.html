    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>When I first started building businesses, regardless of what business I was in, I always took every single deal I could get. I did whatever it took to close more deals and get more money in the bank, no matter who the customer was and what they wanted. I lived by the mantra of ’<a href="http://www.domo.com/blog/2013/03/why-the-first-100-customers-are-so-important-and-why-revenue-cures-all-problems/">revenue cures all problems</a>’. So the default was to <em>always</em> take the money.</p>

<p>What was not clear to me back then was that there is a very real distinction between good &amp; bad revenue. If you have deals coming through the door, you’d be an idiot to turn it down, right? Wrong. Taking bad revenue can be more destructive than leaving it on the table. It adversely affects your business long after the deal is signed — eating away at resources, distracting the team, and thrashing the overall vision / roadmap.</p>

<p>To be clear, my definition of bad revenue is having customers that are not aligned with the direction of your company. They have no interest in what you’re trying to do, they just want you to solve their problems, their way, and now. They look for problems instead of solutions, and rarely (if ever) partner with you to figure out how to get to success – instead opting for threats. A net negative for your business, regardless of how much they pay (in most cases).</p>

<p>The inverse is good revenue. With these customers, they feel like they’re an extension of your team. They listen &amp; work with you, have valuable suggestions/feature requests, and overall they understand that they’re partnering with you towards a common goal. This is good revenue — an overwhelmingly net positive in the long term. The gift that keeps giving.</p>

<p>Bad revenue is sometimes tough to spot, but in general, you can identify bad customers during the sales cycle. Many prospects start off with skepticism, doubt, and negative attitudes – but typically you can tell when a customer changes their perspective and comes over to your side. Bad customers never get over that hump and they fight you all the way to the end, negotiating for pennies, trying to force contingencies and commitments before signing, etc.</p>

<p>Reading through this, it might seem obvious — you just never want take bad revenue. Identifying bad revenue upfront can be tricky, but the tougher part is having the discipline to stick to it. Especially if the quarter is closing or you have some milestone to meet, if the money is in front of you, it’s really hard not take it.</p>

<p>So this year I wanted to make sure that we stopped taking bad revenue. And from what I’ve found, the easiest way to do this is develop a very clear vision for the company, product, and the roadmap. This way no matter what comes up, everybody has a very clear framework to evaluate it against, and making these decisions becomes a lot easier.</p>"/>
