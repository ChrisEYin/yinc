<p>Yesterday, we saw the launch of Tidal. It was pretty weird, you can <a href="http://tidal.com/us">watch it here</a>.</p>

<p>If you don’t already know (I didn’t), Jay-Z bought a music streaming service, Tidal, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/30/7950317/Jay-z-buys-tidal-wimp-aspiro-to-take-on-spotify">for $56 million</a> a few months ago. He then relaunched the music streaming service yesterday with several other artists, each of them getting a piece of the company.</p>

<p>About the service itself, here’s what I know —</p>

<ol>
<li>It’s like Spotify, but you have to pay to use it. And with less music.</li>

<li>For $20 a month, you get lossless audio compression. For $10 a month, it’s a regular digital music.</li>

<li>Because artists have banded together, they claim they’ll have exclusive content that no other service can provide.</li>

<li>Artists on Tidal will get 2x the royalties for lossless listeners, and 1x for regular. Which is supposedly more than what Spotify pays out.</li>
</ol>

<p>The premise around this seems to be that artists are getting paid less than they’d like to via Spotify. So they’re banding together to build their own music service where they’ll get paid more. Computers!</p>

<p>A few problems I see with this approach —</p>

<p><strong>Paid Only</strong></p>

<p>I’m not convinced that consumers care about artists getting paid more than they care about their own money. That’s why the consumer internet world is always about free. Sure, there are people who will pay for services, but the vast majority are cheap (like myself). If there is a free option, you can bet your ass that 95% of people are taking the free option. The paid only model immediately shuts out the bulk of users, cutting out most of their audience. And I can’t imagine less listeners is good for business.</p>

<p><strong>High Quality Music</strong></p>

<p>Next is the high quality lossless music angle. If you’ve ever listened to a FLAC file, I would challenge you to compare it to a regular file and see which one’s better. I bet you wouldn’t be able to. It’s not you — it’s because sound quality is not just about how a file is compressed, but also the hardware it comes out in. For standard laptops/phones, the output device is not a high quality output, so the lossless audio file is useless. In addition, even if you had the converter, you’d also need high quality headphones to match. While some consumers may have high quality headphones, I doubt most users have both pieces of hardware to support this.</p>

<p><strong>Exclusive Content</strong></p>

<p>Sure, in theory, if all artists banded together and promised each other they would only use the same distribution channels for their music, then Tidal could have some exclusive content. The question then becomes, will that exclusive content really drive more users to the service? It must be pretty damn exclusive to get me to pay $10 a month, meaning I can’t hear it <em>anywhere</em> else and there’s enough of it so that I would continue to pay for it after I get my fix. So if most users are like me and don’t want to pay, then this exclusive content angle won’t get a ton of extra listeners. And users aren’t coming to get this exclusive content, you think artists will stick to their promise of using Tidal as their only source of distribution? Doubtful.</p>

<p><strong>Royalties</strong></p>

<p>And lastly, the royalty bit seems to be a reaction to Spotify’s <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2012/09/26/161758720/how-musicians-make-money-by-the-fraction-of-a-cent-on-spotify">‘low royalties’</a>. The fallacy is that it’s the labels that are the ones that are not paying artits the royalties they want, not Spotify. So creating a new service doesn’t change a whole lot. And in addition, royalties are driven by listeners, and for all the reasons above, not convinced that they will have a critical mass of listeners for these higher royalties to have any material impact.</p>
<hr />
<p>Aside from all the above, it certainly seems like some several artists are putting in some effort to make this all real &amp; believable. While there is a chance that they’ll band together and pull their music from all other online sources and only focus on Tidal, I think they’ll quickly find that the paywall is going to drive users away. And I doubt less listeners is the outcome they were going for.</p>

<p>This seems like an episode of — ‘I’ve used an computer, I could build this better.’ Not only woefully naive, but my issue with all of this is not about product or the business, but intentions. To create a successful business (software or any kind), it’s about providing customers with something they want. And from the above, it seems like these artists are really focused on getting themselves more of what they want, instead of bringing value to customers.</p>"/>
