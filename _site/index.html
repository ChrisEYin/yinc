            <p><p>I bought my folks a Nest over break. The question I hear a lot is – is it worth the ~$300?</p>

<p>TL;DR - Yes. It’s good for now, but not perfect. Review below.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p><img src="/img/nest.jpg" alt="nest" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://nest.com/thermostat/life-with-nest-thermostat/">Nest Thermostat</a> is a ‘smart’ thermostat that learns from your habits to reduce wateful spending. Touting features like auto away (turning heat down automatically when you’re out), self learning (setting optimal temperatures itself) and more, it’s a pretty compelling buy. And not to mention that it looks awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Validation &amp; Installation</strong></p>

<p>Before you can use the Nest, you have to make sure it’s compatible with your house. To find out, you remove the cover of your current thermostat, go to the <a href="https://widgets.nest.com/compatibility/">Nest compatibility site</a> and check a few wires.</p>

<p><img src="/img/nest2.jpg" alt="old-thermostat" /></p>

<p>In my case, I had a W, Rh, Y, G, and another tying Rh to Rc. I emailed them in case (<a href="mailto:photos@nest.com">photos@nest.com</a>) and they were pretty quick (within 6 hours) to respond and confirm.</p>

<p>On the site, I was returned with this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/nest3.png" alt="diagram" /></p>

<p>Was unsure of what to do with the Rh to Rc wire, so I left it off. Discovered later that <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/How-do-I-install-Nest-if-my-old-thermostat-had-a-short-wire-connecting-Rh-and-Rc">it wasn’t necessary</a> (aside – found a fair amount of people with the same question, so would have been helpful to include in setup instructions.</p>

<p><img src="http://bit.ly/KgH7Wn" alt="install" /></p>

<p>Installation was pretty straightforward – turn off the electricity via circuit box, remove old thermostat, screw in Nest plate, plug in wires, and then put the Nest on top of it. 15-20 min.</p>

<p><strong>Setup</strong></p>

<p>Once it’s on, configuration was easy – it takes you through a few setup screens – name your Nest, set the network, time zone, default temp, etc.</p>

<p>Once this was done, next was to link my phone. Created a Nest account on their <a href="https://home.nest.com/">website</a>, and it auto linked my account to my Nest based on the network. Again, pretty smooth &amp; easy.</p>

<p><strong>Using the Nest</strong></p>

<p>Although everything had been easy up to this point, learning more about using Nest was a bit lacking. Outside of learning by pushing buttons, Nest has a <a href="https://community.nest.com/community/help-with-nest">Community</a> and <a href="http://support.nest.com/thermostat/">Support</a> page on their site. While these pages provided some info, I was still hoping to get into more detail on all their features and how to optimally configure/use it. There’s almost nothing useful in the box, and what I <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/An-introduction-to-learning">found</a> on the web wasn’t enough for me.</p>

<p>Many of the cool features – <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/An-introduction-to-learning">Learning</a>, <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/How-does-Auto-Schedule-learn">Scheduling</a>, <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/What-is-Early-On">Early On</a>, <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/How-does-the-Nest-Leaf-work">Leaf</a>, <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/How-to-read-my-Energy-History-on-the-Nest-Learning-Thermostat">Energy Savings</a> and more, are things that develop over time. To learn more, I had to look into a forum or community thread – it would have been helpful to get information straight from Nest – list of features, how/when to use X feature, when to check back in to make sure it’s being used properly, etc.</p>

<p>If this info is up front and center as opposed to hidden in support, users will better understand what Nest is doing and how to get the most out of it. While I understand the goal of Nest is to ‘set it and forget it’, it would have been helpful to spell out the features for users so they don’t have to go digging through the the forums to find the answers.</p>

<p><strong>UI/UX</strong></p>

<p>I realize this is a fairly large upgrade from the standard thermostat in terms of aesthetic/usability – and although the UX is nice, I was a bit disappointed in the UI, both on the device and the apps (<a href="https://home.nest.com/">web</a> &amp; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id464988855?mt=8">mobile</a>). While you have to take the 2 1/2 stars and poor reviews with a grain of salt, the apps could definitely use some improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Support</strong></p>

<p>This is the one area that scared me a bit. After initially setting up the Nest, we left town for a day. Upon return, I was excited to turn on the Nest &amp; pre-heat the house remotely – but the app said the Nest was offline. After getting back and checking – Nest having trouble connecting to the network because of low battery.</p>

<p>Totally unaware there was even a battery (thought it powered through the wall), I went online to figure out what was going on.</p>

<p><img src="/img/nest5.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>Found this on the support page and it <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/Intermittent-low-battery-or-connectivity-issues-with-thermostat-software-4-0">lead to this article</a>. With no steps to fix, had to search a bit more and found <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/What-s-the-mini-USB-port-on-the-back-of-the-display-for">this article</a> – had to recharge Nest through an outlet so we could use &amp; reconnect in the interim (next up was <a href="http://shaunmerrigan.info/site-news/nest-thermostat-battery-charge-problem-and-solution/">this</a> if it didn’t work). Let it charge for ~1hr and set it back on the wall. Haven’t had a problem since, but the lack of clear steps for a resolution left me a bit uneasy.</p>

<p>While perusing the support pages during this time, I found a few frustrated people with Nest’s seemingly lack of care for support issues. With only a support email alias and no direct number, I can see why. While email only support is fairly common for startups, not sure if this is a good approach for home consumer products.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Overall, I’ve had a good experience with Nest and would generally recommend it.</p>

<p>It’s clear the Nest guys spent a lot of time building a beautiful product. However, the experience as a whole feels incomplete.</p>

<p>The aesthetics and functionality of the product are amazing and undoubtedly a step up from a traditional thermostat. But as for continuing to support and help users maximize usage of the product after installation, Nest could use some improvement.</p>

<p>By simply adding a detailed user manual so users know how they’re benefitting from Nest’s features and providing a better support site or line, they could dramatically improve the overall experience. Otherwise, Nest runs the risk of being perceived as an expensive remote control for your thermostat.</p>

<p>So if you’re into new toys and want to upgrade – Nest is perfect for you. But I think for now, Nest will remain an expensive toy in consumers’ eyes until it has spent more time in the market proving that it is worth the cost.</p></p>

            <p><p><em>This is a follow up post to <a href="http://bit.ly/1hxzntZ">Building for the Enterprise</a>.</em></p>

<p>For startups, the business space may seem like a gold mine. There are problems everywhere you look, customers will pay you to fix them, and there’s not millions of other startups competing with you.</p>

<p>While these attributes can make the business space attractive, not all problems are applicable to every business. Entrepreneurs must understand the types of problems they are solving in relation to the priorities of the companies they’re targeting.</p>
<hr />
<p>Companies are filled with problems. Productivity, collaboration, operations, hiring, legal, sales, support, etc. But depending on the stage of the business – early, growth, pre-IPO, public, etc. – each one will have different priorities (in regards to problems that need to be solved).</p>

<p>For instance, take an early stage company – their focus may be marketing &amp; sales. In this case, the priority is to find a solution to help them manage deals. A growth stage company’s main focus may be managing support – so they’ll be looking for a support tool. And so on.</p>

<p>So to determine if a problem fits a company’s stage, simply ask – is this a C-level problem? C-level issues are problems important enough that a CEO/exec will prioritize it. Usually only then will it get solved in a timely manner; otherwise, it may not get solved in a time frame that you can stomach (or afford).</p>
<hr />
<p>At <a href="http://tcrn.ch/18MuCue">Xpenser</a> &amp; <a href="http://tcrn.ch/18Muzyn">Coupa</a>, we made and sold an expense management solution – a web/mobile app that helped companies create, approve and reimburse their employees’ expense reports. More than making it easier for employees to capture their expenses &amp; get reimbursed, our software streamlines the reimbursement process – helping companies reduce the operational cost of processing and managing lots of expense reports.</p>

<p>Since our solution reduces cost, we have to target companies whose priority is cost reduction. Typically smaller companies are more focused on the top line (sales), while larger companies can also focus on the bottom line (cost).</p>

<p>To get these large enterprises, our strategy (product, sales, marketing) has to reflect how they buy software – through RFP’s, direct sales, analyst reports, etc. We need an enterprise roadmap, the right messaging, and an enterprise sales team in order to maximize our ROI.</p>

<p>Our previous model – freemium/bottom up – was not the most effective way to reach our customer. While we aimed for large deals, this model attracted consumers and SMB’s – because the freemium model was akin to how consumers/SMB’s bought software, not how large companies bought software.</p>

<p>And for many of the SMB’s that we did engage – they sale either dragged on for too long or eventually petered out – because even though we had gotten into the business, that particular problem wasn’t a C-level problem or a business priority. Our strategy didn’t match our target customer’s stage or how they bought software.</p>

<p>So before you take the popular sentiment of building a freemium SaaS, make sure you understand the problem you’re solving and what stage of company is interested – and then build your strategy around that.</p></p>

            <p><p>A little over a year ago, I joined <a href="http://tcrn.ch/18MuCue">Xpenser</a> – a startup building expense management tools for businesses and individuals. We were 4 years old, bootstrapped, small (3 full time + interns), ~85K users and ~150 paying customers.</p>

<p>It was my first time building for businesses. I studied and learned about building product for companies, how to sell, marketing, support, scaling, recruiting, etc.</p>

<p>About 6 months later, we were acquired by <a href="http://tcrn.ch/18Muzyn">Coupa</a>, a spend management company, to help run &amp; build upon their existing expense management business.</p>

<p>After we started at Coupa, I thought I’d be doing the same thing I was doing at Xpenser, but just at a different company. The setting would be different, but the goals were the same – build the best expense management solution for the businesses. At the time we joined, Coupa was 6 years old, had raised ~$50M in venture capital, ~150 people, and 400+ paying customers.</p>

<p>I was wrong. Even though both times we were solving the same problem &amp; selling to companies, the lessons I learned didn’t apply universally. At Xpenser we were selling to businesses; at Coupa, we were selling to the enterprise.</p>
<hr />
<p>As a student of the startup game, both times (at Xpenser &amp; Coupa) I went to the web to learn from founders/entrepreneurs. Both times I found little helpful information, and in many cases, what I did find turned out to just be plain wrong.</p>

<p>The majority of startup advice I found on the web was directed at consumer startups. And that made sense – for a startup whose customers are other businesses, you don’t want to keep gushing your mistakes in a public forum. That kind of information will kill you in a sale. Opacity and boilerplate press releases were safer than honest blog posts.</p>

<p>So it’s hard to find good information on the web for startups to learn about building for businesses. For what I did find – there seemed to be a general misconception – B2B does not always mean enterprise. There is some gray area, but for the most part, there is a distinction between building for businesses and buidling for the enterprise. There is a difference, and those differences should shape your strategy.</p>

<p>After serving and building for all types of businesses at both Xpenser &amp; Coupa, I’ve learned a bit about the space, and I’ll be sharing what I’ve learned here. <a href="http://eepurl.com/DdF7n">Click here to subscribe</a>!</p></p>

            <h2 class="title"><a href="/2013/08/20/becoming-a-leader/" rel="prefetch">The First Step To Becoming A Leader</a></h2>
            <p><p>What is a leader?</p>

<p>A leader is someone who drives a group of people towards a common goal.</p>

<p>Leaders come in all different flavors, but the best leaders all have a few things in common – they have a clear vision and they are the drivers that push it all forward.</p>

<p>So what does it take to become a leader? Charisma, salesmanship, product sense, etc. are all pieces of it, but not the key element. At the core, a leader is someone who simply makes good decisions for the group.</p>
<hr />
<p>I believe that everyone knows what a good decision looks like. People either explicitly know what it is, or they are able to “feel” when a decision is right. Intuition is still always there as a fail safe.</p>

<p>Then why isn’t everyone a leader?</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, most people don’t speak their minds. They stifle their own voice and default to the majority. The majority must know better, be smarter, have more experience, etc. This can be especially true if you’re in a group full of people smarter than you.</p>

<p>To become a leader, all you have to do is start speaking your mind. That simple.</p>

<p>Speaking your mind is how you learn. You force yourself to have an opinion, take a side, and voice it publicly. If you’re consistently right, people will recognize this and you will quickly evolve into the decision making authority and leader.</p>

<p>But when you speak up, you might not always be right. In fact, when you start to really speak your mind, there’s a good chance you’ll often be wrong. When this happens, it can certainly be easy to hide behind silence.</p>

<p>If you’re wrong, people might call you an idiot. And in the short term, you might actually feel like an idiot.</p>

<p>But it doesn’t matter. When you put yourself out there, you expose your actual thoughts. You create a voice for yourself as well as subjecting your thought process to criticism.</p>

<p>Take in the criticism, recalibrate, and try again. You can tweak what was wrong before, and constantly iterate your thought process to success.</p>

<p>When you say nothing, you never put yourself out there. By not exposing what you think, you never challenge your own thought process, your ideas, and your beliefs. It’s easier to hide behind silence than subject yourself to the risk of ridicule. Over time, however, those that speak out will continue to improve and others will remain static.</p>

<p>After constantly interating and optimizing your thought process, you’ll start to hone your instincts and begin making the right decisions. By this point you’ll have a voice for yourself in the group, have confidence in your opinions, and have naturally evolved into a leader for your group.</p>
<hr />
<p>I’ve typically been pretty outspoken. And while this might all seem like common sense, I found that once I started paying attention to myself, I realized I was subconsciously defaulted to the majority on a several things that I actually had an opinions on.</p>

<p>I caught myself and changed my behavior, but I wouldve never realized that I was keeping quiet until I started to explicitly watch my own behavior.</p>

<p>Give it a shot, would love to hear thoughts or if you’ve had a similar experience.</p></p>

            <p><p>Over the last few months I’ve been in a depression.</p>

<p>Not a mental depression, but a depression in regards to personal development.</p>

<p>I define personal development as doing things that you enjoy working on in your free time. Not just anything, but things you actively work on to get better at without any external motivation to do so.</p>

<p>Recently I’ve spent all of my time working on my day job instead of taking the time to do any personal development. Things like reading, writing, or working on personal side projects that don’t make any money :).</p>

<p>By spending all of my time working, I’m actually getting worse at work. And I’m not getting any better at my personal interests. Doubly bad.</p>
<hr />
<p>It’s easy to get sucked into work. They pay you. Projects are handed to you. You feel productive when you work on something. You know what you have to deliver. Strategy and goals are set for you – you just have to execute. Things are relatively straightforward.</p>

<p>Too often these factors lead people to spend all of time working. With non-stop work emails as the new norm and every email marked as <em>URGENT!!!</em>, it’s easy to feel like it’s irresponsible to do anything other than work.</p>

<p>The problem with constant working is that while you might feel like you’re being productive, you’re only making incremental improvements. By constantly working on the same thing – you close your mind and limit your ability to think and grow.</p>

<p>In order to innovate and make real strides in your career/ life, it’s essential to lift yourself out of the day to day tactical work and just <em>do other things</em>. Finish a book, write a blog post, volunteer, or work on a side project. Get out of the building.</p>

<p>By spending time applying your mind to other problems, you can learn and draw inspiration from outside. When you are focused on 1 problem, you develop tunnel vision. Your thinking narrows, and your thoughts can get boxed in. When you venture outside and let go, you’re able to re-open your mind and see things in a novel way.</p>

<p>Outside of work, by developing other skills, you simply become a more valuable person. You learn new skill set, open your mind, and become a much more versatile thinker.</p>

<p>As a personal anecdote, I’ve found my best ideas come from moments where my mind is farthest from the problem at hand. If I get stuck on something, I’ll start writing a post or start working on a side project and the answer serendipitously strikes me.</p>

<p>The difficulty for me is finding the right balance. I’m particularly fond of the way Jeff Atwood describes it in his post, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/03/sharpening-the-saw.html">Sharpening the Saw</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A guy who stumbled into a lumberjack. The lumberjack is feverishly sawing at a very large tree. The lumberjack was sawing and sawing, yet going nowhere. The saw was about as sharp as a butter knife. So, he says to the lumberjack, “I couldn’t help noticing how hard you are working on that tree, but going nowhere.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The lumberjack replies with sweat dripping off of his brow, “Yes…I know.” The bystander replies and says, “But your saw is so dull that it couldn’t possibly cut through anything.” “I know”, says the lumberjack, “but I am too busy sawing to take time to sharpen my saw.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure if the post is meant to be read this way – but to me, working is the tactical action of sawing away at the tree. Personal development is the act of sharpening the saw. In order to maximize your efficiency, you must find a balance between the two.</p>

<p>Constantly re-assess yourself, and be ruthlessly intellectually honest. Spend too much time sawing away and you never make a real impact. Spend too much time sharpening the saw, and you never get anywhere.</p>

<p>So force yourself to take time and do other things. Especially in startup, it can be hard to pry yourself away from all of the critical things happening. But make sure to take time every day or at least every week to let go of work and focus on building your own personal skill set and interests. You will end up serving not only your company, but also yourself much better in the long run.</p></p>

            <p><p>Just finished <a href="http://amzn.to/114Pvtg">Made to Stick</a>. Here are some quick notes.</p>

<p>The book is about how to turn your ideas into reality. Ideas are incredibly powerful– they are the root of everything we do. They can do something as simple as convince your friends to a restaurant you’ve wanted to try, all the way to getting somebody to quit their cushy job and help you start that company you’ve wanted to build.</p>

<p>But frequently our ideas get ignored. Months later after an opportunity has been missed or taken advantage of by someone else, you mutter under your breath, ‘I had that idea months ago.’ A useless comment – you failed to get the buy in because you couldn’t convey the value of the idea.</p>

<p>Miscommunication is defined as when an expert (someone who thinks abstractly) can’t communicate with a novice (thinks concretely). The book provides a framework to bridge that gap.</p>

<p>It’s called the SUCCESs framework (a bit cheesy, I know, but bear with me).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>S</strong>imple <br /> <strong>U</strong>nexpected <br /> <strong>C</strong>oncrete <br /> <strong>C</strong>redible <br /> <strong>E</strong>motional <br /> <strong>S</strong>tory <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Simple</strong></p>

<p>Keep it simple. Every idea can be conveyed in 1 simple sentence.</p>

<p>An example – Southwest Airlines. Their mantra is, ‘We are <em>the</em> low cost airline provider’. Nothing gets in the way of that. When people are coming up with new ideas, adding new things, changing things – they always go back to that single idea. Does this help us become the low cost air provider? If not, then the answer is no.</p>

<p>It’s simple, powerful, and succinct. Everyone can remember it and start to make better decisions based on it.</p>

<p><strong>Unexpected</strong></p>

<p>If you can’t grab people’s attention, they won’t listen. If people don’t listen, you can’t get your idea out. You need to do/say something unexpected or contrarian to get people listening and thinking.</p>

<p>Create knowledge gaps. Lead people down a road and pause – as they fill in the next part on their own – reveal something unexpected. It’ll catch them off guard and keep them hooked, with the added benefit of creating a platform for them to start coming up with their own ideas/thoughts.</p>

<p><strong>Concrete</strong></p>

<p>Concrete details are how to appeal to the masses. But concrete details are a double edged sword – say too little and nobody knows what you’re talking about. Say too much, and the audience loses interest.</p>

<p>Limit concrete details to 3 things – <em>associations</em>, <em>self interest</em>, and <em>identities</em>.</p>

<p>Associations are things people are familiar with. You can describe a grapefruit to someone who’s never seen a grapefruit in 2 ways – as either a fruit with a soft &amp; porous skin with an edible pulp, or you can just say it’s a larger, bitter orange. Simple and concrete.</p>

<p>2nd is self interest – what is in it for me. The audience wants to know why they should care. Use concrete details to describe and sell the benefit of the benefit. You’re not selling power drills, you’re selling the ability for the audience to hang up pictures of their kids on the wall.</p>

<p>Last is identities. Who am I, and what would someone like me do? Play to people’s identities – learn what that group wants, and then describe it in detail.</p>

<p><strong>Credible</strong></p>

<p>You have to be credible. Reference experts (Dr. Yin says don’t smoke), aspirational people/celebrities (Lebron doesn’t smoke), the antihero (this ex-smoker with cancer says don’t smoke), or yourself (I quit smoking after I found out I was getting sick).</p>

<p><strong>Emotional</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://bit.ly/13Xah2e" alt="Maslow" /></p>

<p>Maslow’s hierarchy. The lower end is physical needs. The higher end is emotional needs. Take your idea from something serving the lower end of Maslow’s hierarchy and aim higher. The stronger the emotion, the stronger the purpose.</p>

<p>Pegasus hall is an army mess hall in Baghdad. Imagein a mess hall – thousands of sweaty soldiers pouring into a dirty cafeteria. Soldier after soldier in line grabbing food from an assembly line and eating off of a plastic cafeteria tray. Doesn’t conjure a grand image.</p>

<p>One cook realized there was something more. Meal times were not simply just eating. For the soldiers, meal time was downtime; they were recharging. If they didn’t eat well, they would be sluggish and unmotivated during the next mission. If they were took a nice break and relaxed, morale would be high and the would perform better on the field. Meal time wasn’t about food – <em>it was about recharging morale</em>.</p>

<p>The cook spread the word to his team. From then on, Pegasus was known for the amazing meals they prepared. Fresh fruit, perfectly cooked steak, and spotless mess halls. Cooks would go through buckets and buckets of fruit to pick out the good ones. Wade through pounds of bad meat to find good pieces. All for the same pay and with the same ingredients at other inferior mess halls.</p>

<p>Aim high on Maslow’s hierarchy. Serve a higher purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Story</strong></p>

<p>All of the above are components of a good story. Good stories are how experts (think abstractly) communicates with novices (think concretely).</p>

<p>There are 3 types of stories. Challenge, connection and creativity.</p>

<p>Challenge - the classic David vs Goliath story.</p>

<p>Connection - the ‘Chicken Soup’ type of story. An emotional story pulling on your heart strings – ie Help this starving child in Africa, etc.</p>

<p>Creativity - the mental challenge. A story with turns and twists that challenges the audience to follow along and guess what is going to happen next.</p>

<p>Use these types of stories in different situations. If you’re about to go into battle, get your troops riled up by telling a challenge story. If you want people to donate money to your charity, an connection story is probably better.</p>
<hr />
<p>The biggest barrier to doing all this successfully is the curse of knowledge. The curse of knowledge is when you know more than your audience and leave out important details because you assume they are already known.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>

<p>The way to get your ideas out is to become a great storyteller. The best part is you don’t have to create the stories. If you can learn to spot great stories and re-tell them, you’ll be golden.</p>

<p>Use the SUCCESs framework to craft your story and get your idea heard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tell a <strong>S</strong>imple, <strong>U</strong>nexpected, <strong>C</strong>oncrete, <strong>C</strong>redible, and <strong>E</strong>motional <strong>S</strong>tory.</p>

            <p><p>Failure. It’s a daunting thing. People like to talk about celebrating failure. They champion it like it’s something to do.</p>

<p>I think that’s ridiculous.</p>

<p>Let me start off — I’m a big proponent of failing fast and making mistakes. I think it’s a great learning tool. As it goes,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Good judgement comes from experience. And experience comes from bad judgement.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But some people talk about failure as if it deserves the merits of success. I don’t agree with that. While I believe failure certainly is a prerequisite to success, I don’t think it is an indicator.</p>

<p>Failing makes me nauseous. It sucks. It’s embarrassing. You fail because you were wrong, because didn’t try hard enough, or because you just aren’t good enough. Failing is a direct reflection of your ability. So when you fail, it means you suck. And that sucks.</p>

<p>I juggle between two thoughts. 1 — I fail because I’m trying new things I’m uncomfortable with, moving forward and learning. 2 — I fail because I suck. I didn’t think it through carefully enough, and it’s a symptom of a bigger problem. To be honest, I’m not sure which is true. (Although I think I know the answer ;) )</p>

<p>What I can say is that I learn by doing. Some people like to think through a million scenarios before deciding on anything. I act, and then improve iteratively. To me, thinking and theory are great — but there is no teacher like experience.</p>

<p>As a result, I move faster than others. As another result, I’m usually the first to make mistakes and break things. And get in trouble. But I also typically learn at the highest velocity.</p>

<p>The toughest part for me is not letting the fear of more failures become the driver. It’s easy to crawl into a hole and pity yourself. Hope time will wash it all away. It doesn’t, and by staying in the hole, you make it harder to get out.</p>

<p>The way to overcome the fear and the failure is to move on. Move forward, be bold and make the best of what is remaining. Oftentimes I’m able to rise out of the gutter and succeed just by acting as if my prior mistake was totally insignificant. Inside, the mistake eats at me day by day until I’m able to drown it out with a resouding success.</p>

<p>Let victory wash away the stench of failure, not time or pity.</p>

<p>It’s a struggle, and I’m hoping to get better at it. I often wonder if I should be more concerned about failing less or learning to overcome the inevitable failure better. I have no idea.</p></p>

            <p><p>Lately, I’ve been driving up to LA more often (I’m in San Diego). I hate the drive, so I usually throw a <a href="http://bit.ly/10cuVtN" title="PandoMonthly">PandoMonthly</a> talk into my car to help pass time. They’re all spectacular, but one that continues to stick out is the <a href="http://bit.ly/15q6s8T" title="Fireside Chat with Ben Horowitz">Ben Horowitz chat</a>. The whole thing is awesome — but one quote in particular resonated with me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The number one thing we look for in an entrepreneur is courage. Aristotle said that courage is the first virtue. Reason is, if you don’t have that — you don’t have any virtue. All the other things — honesty, integrity — they don’t get activated unless you have courage. It’s easy to be honest — unless it’s going to cost you your job, your marriage, or something else that you care about. Then it’s hard to be honest. So without courage, and you don’t have anything. You’re a zero character person.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It struck a chord with me. Courage really is the cornerstone of everything. You always start with raw courage, and build up from there. Without it, your character is ephemeral — constantly fluctuating and adapting to the situation. Sometimes low quality, sometimes medium, probably never high. There’s no concept of yourself. You’re merely trying to fit in instead of injecting your own flavor. Zero character.</p>

<p>You need courage. Otherwise you can’t be successful or happy. Real success requires being innovative and original. You can’t do that through imitation. Without courage, you try and fit in through imitation. And by definition, a copycat is always 2nd to originality.</p>

<p>And you won’t be happy. You’re constantly trying to fit in, instead of being yourself. You ignore things that bother you, and you start to build resentment. Ultimately, that becomes destructive — you burn out and stop caring about your work quality, environment, relationships, etc. And since work takes up most of our working hours, you can’t be happy if you’re unhappy at work.</p>

<p>But when you are courageous, everything seems to magically align. When I say courageous, I mean — speak up when you think something is wrong. Ask questions, have an opinion, do what you think is right. Don’t worry about what the norm is or what other people will think. Be yourself.</p>

<p>You might step on some toes. You might piss some people off. They’ll get over it. In the long run, people will respect you for having an opinion and being honest. You’ll develop a unique reputation and maybe even make some friends. But regardless, you’ll be unique and have some character.</p>

<p>And lastly, being courageous is easy — you just have to act like yourself all the time. It’s very natural, easy, and stress free. You maximize learning and minimize regret. If you disagree with everyone and are vocal about it — you’re either wrong and end up learning, or you’re right and look like a genius. There is no losing outcome.</p>

<p>So be courageous, live your life. It’s the surest way to be happy and successful.</p></p>
